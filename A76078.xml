         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou deſire to know the occaſion of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe betweene mee and Maſter <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> (of whom I may ſay this, although he be an enemy, that hee is both <hi>generoſus &amp; doctus adverſarius</hi>) thou ſhalt not onely be fully ſatisfied of the neceſſity of the publiſhing of it, but mayſt alſo finde the true Church by the eſſentiall and undeceivable notes of the ſame, the which whereſoever they appeare doe abundantly prove and delucidate it to be a true Church: Now when they are to be found in the Church of England, as in all the reformed Churches, it may truely be concluded of them all, that they are true Churches, from the which there is no juſt ground and cauſe of ſeparation. As for the Church of England, I may ever affirme this (as I have in the following Treatiſe evinced) that ſince the Apoſtles times, the Goſpell and the ſaving truths thereof have never been more purely preached, and more chearfully received, imbraced, and believed, and the Sacraments more duely adminiſtred, and the Name of God more truly invocated and called upon, then now in the Church of England: &amp; that all thoſe that live in it, owe their converſion to the Miniſtery of the ſame: ſo that with
<pb facs="tcp:158688:3"/>all good reaſon wee may infer, that, that Church that teacheth the knowledge <hi>of the onely true God, and whom hee hath ſent Jeſus Chriſt, John 17.</hi> and is able to build them up in their moſt holy faith, is a true Church and where ſalvation may be found. And therefore not onely thoſe of the Church of Rome, that do calumniate her, and all the reformed Churches for hereticall, are in a great errour and blame-worthy: but more eſpecially thoſe that had the worke of regeneration wrought in their hearts by her miniſtery, and owe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to her, and yet doe aſperſe her with odious tearmes abſolutely denying her to be a true Church: all ſuch, I ſay, are likewiſe to be reproved, and have for this their temerity a great deale to anſwer for, before God and all good men: for by theſe their expreſſions, they doe not onely proclaime their owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulneſſe unto Almighty God, but their undutifulneſſe and ingratitude unto their mother, and their uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards their brethren, whom they account of as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Inſidels denying communion with them, in holy things, though every way as good and as holy as themſelves: by all which their proceedings, they doe not onely caſt filth in all their faces, and expoſe themſelves to the ludibree of the world, and bring an odium upon the whole Church, but are a cauſe of diviſion and ſchiſme in the ſeamleſſe garment of Chriſt, and give a great ſcandall to the enemies of the Goſpell, and to all ſuch as love the truth in ſincerity without faction, contrary to the Apoſtles rule, who exhorts all Chriſtians to take heed that they give no offence <hi>to the Jew nor to the Gentile, nor to the Church of God.</hi> But that all men may ſee I charge none falſly, nor wrong them not in any thing, I ſhall here recite ſome expreſſions of their principall leaders and teachers (for to enumerate them all, would be an endleſſe worke) as I had them from their owne mouthes in the preſence of others, and as I finde them in their printed bookes. By word of mouth, they ſay, <hi>That the Church of England is an
<pb facs="tcp:158688:3"/>arrant Whore, and Strumpet, and that ſhe that was once a Whore can never be preſented unto Chriſt as a chaſte Spouſe:</hi> then the which what could be more contumelioſly diſgracefully and untruly ſpoken, eſpecially when it is uttered by ſuch as had the worke of grace and converſion wrought in their hearts, by the miniſtery of the Church, (if they have any grace, or were ever truely converted) though now they have diſobediently deſerted and forſaken her. In print thus they declare themſelves, concerning the Church of England, and all believers and their fellow brethren in it. <hi>That the Church of England is a true whoriſh mother, and that they that are of her, are baſe begotten, and baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly children, and that ſhe neither is, nor never was truely married, joyned, or united unto Jeſus Chriſt, in that eſpouſall band, which his true Churches are, and ought to be, but is one of Antichriſts Nationall whoriſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Cities, ſpoken of Revel. 16.19. &amp;c. That the Church of England is falſe and Antichriſtian, and as ſhee is a falſe and Antichriſtian Church, ſhee can never make true Officers and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and abſolutely deny, <hi>that converſion and confirmation, and building up in the waies of God are wrought by the Miniſtery of the Church of England: for how (ſay they) can they build them up in that, which they themſelves are ignorant of, and enemies unto? For as Jannes and Jambres with ſtood Moſes, ſo doe theſe men alſo reſiſt the truth, being men of corrupt minds and deſtitute of the truth, &amp;c.</hi> This is their Dialect and further they aſſert, <hi>That as they have taken paines by the Word of God, and demonſtrable arguments grounded thereupon to prove the Church of England Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; ſo they promiſe to all the world, that they will in the ſtrength of the Lord of Hoſts, for ever ſeperate
<pb facs="tcp:158688:4"/>from Cuurch Miniſtery, and worſhip of England, and all and every one of them as Antichriſtian and falſe And conclude, that all the Miniſters of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are not true Miniſters of Chriſt, but falſe and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Miniſters, and that our Religion neither is the true Religion, nor that it leads men the true way to ſalvation, and they affirme that they groundedly and abſolutely deny that either the Church of England is or ever was a true Church.</hi> And from many ſuch premiſes as theſe, they exhort all good people that are in the boſome of the Church of England, <hi>as they love their owne inward peace, and ſpirituall joy, to withdraw their ſpirituall obedience and ſubjection from her.</hi> Others of them eſteem no better of their brethren then of Inſidels, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers and Heathens, and proclaime them in their writings publiſhed by authority, to be <hi>men who deny, diſclaime, and preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſts Kingly government over his Churches, men unconverted or at leaſt converted but in part, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the maine thing, to wit, Chriſts Kingly Office: men viſibly out of the Covenant of grace, who have not ſo much as an outward profeſſion of faith, who deny Chriſt to be their King, to whoſe perſons and infants, the very Sacraments and Seales of grace with all Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, may and ought to be denyed.</hi> And this is the language and opinion of many, as their Pulpits can witneſſe, and their Pamphlets declare, in the which they ſignifie unto us likewiſe, that they have not ſpoke all they can plead for themſelves, and againſt us, but that they doe keepe a <hi>reſerve donee ad Triarios redierit res, untill it come to a dead lift, in caſe they ſhall be brought before Princes and Rulers to give an account of what they do or deſire.</hi> Theſe are their formall words, and farther adde, <hi>that we put them upon too unreaſonable a taske to ſatisfie us in all that
<pb facs="tcp:158688:4"/>they do and deſire.</hi> Whereas Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle chap. <hi>3. commands all Chriſtians to be ready to give a reaſon of their hope to every one that ſhall demand it of them.</hi> And as by ſuch expreſſions as theſe, it doth evidently appeare they jugle, and deale not candidly with their brethren, and according to the revealed Will of God, and the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who delivered unto the Epheſians the whole counſell of God, and kept no reſerve, <hi>donee ad Triarios redierit res, untill it came to a dead lift, and that he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Kings &amp; Rulers; but publiquely and privately from houſe to houſe, night and day,</hi> taught them the whole counſell and will of God, and withheld nothing that concerned them to know or practice, nor never ketp any <hi>reſerve, Act. 20.</hi> So alſo they publiſh their uncharitableneſſe and unchriſtian dealing towards their brethren whiles they not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale from them, and keepe a reſerve of ſuch things as they pretend are conducible to bring them to ſalvation, and to a more perfect knowledge of Jeſus Christ and of the good will, pleaſure, and waies of God: but whiles they <hi>un-Church, un-Chriſtian,</hi> and un-Miniſter them likewiſe, and make them all no better then the off-ſcouring of the earth, and a company of cast-awaies, which they doe in word and deed, as their daily practice doth teſtifie, and manifeſt to all men, when they ſeparate from our Congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and proclaime us all a falſe and an Antichriſtian Church, and enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome. Now that I may manifeſt unto all the World, that the Papiſts who accuſe our Church to be hereticall doe moſt impiouſly and malignantly abuſe us, and that all other that deny the Church of England to be a true Church, doe alſo moſt maliciouſly, and falſely traduce us, and belie the truth, and for the convincing of both their errours, and maintenance of the truth, and in the juſt defence of the Church of England and for the proving of her a true Church, and for the ſtopping alſo of the mouthes
<pb facs="tcp:158688:5"/>of all gainſayers, I have publiſhed the following diſcourſe, which if thou Chriſtian Reader ſhalt peruſe without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate opinion, I doubt not but thou wilt finde arguments ſufficient to prove the Church of England a true Church, and firme reaſons alſo, to continue conſtantly in the communion and fellowſhip of the ſame, and to abhorre thoſe unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able waies of ſeparation, howſoever in their mildest and ſweeteſt diſcourſes, they account of all ſuch as now ſtand up in the defence of the truth againſt the errours of the times, as of a company of <hi>Wolves, Beares, Lyons,</hi> and <hi>Tygers,</hi> (for this is the language they give us, and that in ſuch bookes as in which they profeſſe meekeneſſe of ſpirit) with whom they ought to have no fellowſhip and brotherly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And if thou through the bleſſing of God upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, ſhalt reape any benefit by it, I ſhall deſire thee to give the glory to God, who hath uſed me as an inſtrument, and to eſteeme of him, who as he is, and ever ſhall be <hi>filius Eccleſiae Anglicanae,</hi> ſo thy ſervant for our Maſters ſake,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is nothing in the World I more wiſh and earneſtly pray for, than that God may be glorified, his name and truth known amongſt all men, that they may be ſaved: ſo there is no man, that doth more fervently deſire, and ſhal more diligently endeavour to the uttermoſt of his abilities, to bring men into the right way, how they may come to the knowledge of God, and of themſelves, wherein conſiſts their eternall happineſſe, than my ſelfe. And this I take to be not onely my duty, but the duty indeed of all thoſe that call upon the name of God in ſincerity. And I am moſt aſſured that no ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man will miſinterpret this my zeale, or blame my love, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me, that I wiſh the common ſalvation of mankind, and that they may both know, and conſtantly perſevere in that faith that was once delivered to the Saints of old, <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 3. which all Chriſtians are bound earneſtly to contend for: eſpecially if they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158688:6"/>conſider, that in all this my care, I ſeeke not my ſelfe, or any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate emolument by it, but that men may live happily and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in this world, and be perennally bleſſed when mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life. And this was the principall cauſe that made me ſo willing to ſeeke your acquaintance, and gratifie your deſire, which was, that I would come and conferre with you about points of Religion in controverſie betweene the Church of Rome and us. I confeſſe there were many thouſands in the Kingdom fitter for that imployment, and that might have given better ſatisfaction in thoſe queſtions than my ſelfe: yet becauſe I heard you had been many moneths in priſon, and had earneſtly wiſhed to diſcourſe with any of our religion, and none came to you (as you ſignified to Maſter Lieutenant, &amp; from whom you received this anſwer, that he never had any notice of any ſuch thing before this time) and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding withall, that you had a deſire in particular to diſpute with me, it made me the more willing to imbrace the occaſion, and chiefly becauſe there went a great fame of you, to be a man both of candour, learning, and ingenuity. Which worthy praiſe of yours ſhall never be impeached by me, neither will any man endeavour in the leaſt to diminiſh it, as I hope, if you ſhall ſtand to your reſolution and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne promiſe, which was, that if any man could prove unto you that the Proteſtant Church, or the Church of England, was a true Church, that then you would come to our Church, and be of our profeſſion. All which you did in the preſence of the Lieutenant and many other Gentlemen, then and there againe ſeriouſly proteſt. Now I ſay, if upon evident demonſtration and infallible arguments it ſhall appeare to all men, that the Church of England is a true Church, and where ſalvation may be found, if you ſtand to your promiſe you muſt renounce the Church of Rome, and become a ſonne of the Church of England, a true Proteſtant; and in ſo doing you ſhall bring glory to God, comfort to your ſoule, and have the praiſe of all men for your integrity and faithfulneſſe in your promiſe.</p>
            <p>But that all things may be without confuſion and perturbation, which cannot ſo well be avoyded in diſputations and conferences, I ſhall orderly and methodically ſet down what paſſed between us in our diſputation, and I will neither adde nor detract from the ſubſtance in any thing, yea as neere as I can, I will keepe the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158688:6"/>ſo that the Gentlemen that were there preſent, when they ſee it, may behold my faire dealing and faithfulneſſe in relating every thing. Which that I might the better doe, I leaned not to my owne memory, but made uſe of their notes that tooke our diſcourſe, and have reduced the whole diſpute into that order that will make it eaſie to be underſtood, and as I hope, I ſhall dilucidatly prove the Church of England to be a true Church, ſo alſo that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old and new Teſtament containe all things in them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and neceſſary for our ſalvation, and that they are the onely and infallible rule to which all Chriſtians are tyed, to the end of the world, and from which they are not to ſwerve or decline either to the right hand or to the left, but are bound to make it, and it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the abſolute rule for the regulating of their faith, and the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their manners. The which two laſt propoſitions were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally ſtarted, partly in examining the proofes and by your evaſions, and partly by reaſon of the Gentlemen that were ſtanders by, whom you Maſter <hi>Mountague</hi> and my ſelfe are beholding to for their faire carriage towards us both, whom I could not but with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour mention, not onely for their civility, but indeed Chriſtian behaviour.</p>
            <p>But before I ſet downe my arguments for the proofe of the firſt queſtion, I ſhall crave leave to bring to your memory, wherein I declared my ſelfe before them all, that I agreed with you, which was in this point, that the ordinary way in Gods providence for the converſion and ſaving of men was the Church <hi>where the Goſpell is preached,</hi> which is <hi>the power of God to ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 1. ver. 14. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 14, 15. <hi>Theſe things I write unto thee, hoping to come unto thee ſhortly; but if I tarry longer, that thou mayſt know how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> In this verſe the Apoſtle in an elegant metaphor, compares Gods dealing in making knowne his will and pleaſure unto his people and children, to the cuſtomes of Kings and Princes, who in publiſhing their minds and pleaſures to their ſervants and ſubjects, cauſe their Proclamations to be ſet up upon pillars in their houſes, and before their Palaces, and in the Cities and Townes through their Dominions, after they have proclaimed them by their Officers appointed to that purpoſe, whether their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158688:7"/>people may have recourſe to know their Royall pleaſure. And to this cuſtome, I ſay, of the Potentates and Monarchs of the earth doth <hi>Paul</hi> allude in this his expreſſion, comparing the Church unto a pillar, becauſe in the Church the Lord Jeſus the King of Saints, and King of Kings doth declare his will and pleaſure to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what he would have them to doe, and what he would have them leave undone, what they ſhould believe, and what they ſhould practice; in the performance of all which they may aſſure themſelves of his protection here, and of full deliverance from all their enemies, and of eternall felicity hereafter. So that all thoſe that deſire to be ſaved, and to know the true way to Heaven, they ought to addreſſe themſelves to the true Church, which is the houſe of God, the pillar and ground of truth. Now, that the Church of England is a true Church, and the ground and pillar of truth, is that (Maſter <hi>Montague</hi>) you deny, and which is my taske to prove. Which, if I can evince, you are bound by your promiſe to embrace it, and to relinquiſh the Church of Rome. But before I begin, I thought good to mind you of this, that it was your deſire I ſhould reduce all this diſcourſe into order and ſend it to you, and you promiſed me faithfully to anſwer it. You may remember alſo, that you left it arbitrary what Tranſlation I ſhould uſe, either ours or the Rhemiſts, for it was all one to me, as I told you, and you ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to me in the preſence of them all, that it was indifferent to you. I have therefore made uſe of our owne, becauſe the Tranſlation is beſt knowne to the people, and the other hard to come by; and alſo becauſe many of the learned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Papiſts that have read our laſt Tranſlation have confeſt that it commeth farre nigher the originall than any of the former. But if you ſhall hereafter except againſt it, there ſhall be no difference about that in the handling of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us, for I will then make uſe of yours.</p>
            <p>But now I come to my argument, which is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church that teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile, that is a true Church, the houſe of God, the Church of the living God, the ground and pillar of truth, in which ſalvation may be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Church of England is a Church that teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>the Church of England is a true Church, the ground and pillar of truth, in which ſalvation may be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:158688:7"/>
            <p> For anſwer to which, you firſt made your apology, that if I meant to proceed in a Syllogiſticall way, that you were no Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. To which I replying told you, that I knew very well, that you were a Scholler, and that this way of diſputing was the beſt means of finding out of truth, and that I would leave my argument with you, and not onely for you, but for whomſoever you pleaſed to aſſiſt and help you. To which you anſwered, that it was fairly ſaid, and that it was a faire and ſyllogiſticall way. Notwithſtanding you would reject your owne capacity to anſwer in ſuch a way, reiterating your former expreſſion, ſaying, that you were no Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, no Logitian, no Philoſopher. But, ſaid you, to juſtifie my ſelfe to theſe Gentlemen here, I am content to anſwer to your ſyllogiſme. Then I told you that you muſt deny one of the propoſitions, the major or the minor. To which you anſwered, I deny the minor; it ſtands you upon to prove it. Here I cite the words verbatim, as I find them written by the Scribes.</p>
            <p>But Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> before I come to the proofe of my minor give me leave to ſpeake my opinion of you, for I deſire to traduce no man, nor minoriſe the worth of any man. I conceive that you are every way as learned and accompliſhed for all knowledge in your religion, as any of that fraternity, as well for your naturall abilities and endowments of wit and underſtanding, as for your moſt excellent education, as alſo in regard of the opportunities you have had at home and abroad of attaining to erudition, you ever being in the ſociety of learned men, and in the Schooles of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge, in the which you were never accounted a trewant, who alwaies ſo improved your time, as you have made as good a progreſſe in all learning as any of your yeeres. And in this notion I conſider you, and ſhall ever allow you the full waight of your prayſes, earneſtly intreating you, that you would imploy that talent of underſtanding and learning that God had beſtowed upon you to the advancement of his Glory and Kingdome, and that you would not make uſe of it to the wronging of your owne ſoule, and the dammage of others. And eſpecially I intreat you that in this bright Sun-ſhine of the Goſpell and truth you would open your eyes and not love darkneſſe more than light. And now I come to prove my minor, the truth of which I thus aſſert.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church which is built upon the foundation of Peter, that Church
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158688:8"/>teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall never prevaile, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Church of England is built upon the foundation of Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo, <hi>the Church of England teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile, and is a true Church, the houſe of God, the ground and pillar of truth, where ſalvation may be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwered, that the Church of England was not built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore denied the minor. Which by Gods aſſiſtance in the ſequell I ſhall ſufficiently prove. But as then, I deſired favour, that I might for the benefit of the ſtanders by, and that the enſuing diſcourſe might the better be underſtood by all, interpret the termes of my Syllogiſme. Firſt, what I meant by the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, what I underſtood by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon that foundation; and which but in part you then gave me liberty to expreſſe. So I ſhall now by your good liking take leave more fully to ſet it down, becauſe as I ſaid before, it doth much conduce to the more cleare underſtanding of the following diſputation.</p>
            <p>By the foundation of <hi>Peter</hi> I underſtand Jeſus Chriſt. And it is evident there is no other foundation of <hi>Peter</hi> nor of the true Church. As we may ſee in the 16. of <hi>Matth.</hi> ver. 13, 14. in that parly which was betweene Chriſt and his Apoſtles, where our Saviour asking his Diſciples what men ſaid of him, and they replying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>that ſome ſaid he was John Baptiſt, ſome Elias, and others Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias, or one of the Prophets. Then ſaid Jeſus, but whom ſay yee that I am? And Simon Peter anſwered and ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Bleſsed art thou Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bar-Iona, for fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven. And I ſay unto thee, upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it.</hi> Here <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of all the Diſciples acknowledgeth Jeſus Chriſt to be the foundation of the Church. The ſame he doth <hi>John</hi> the 6. verſ. 69. where againe in the name of all the Apoſtles he ſaith, <hi>We believe and are ſure that thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the living God.</hi> And in the verſe before he ſaid, <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we goe? thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> There was no other rock known to <hi>Peter</hi> and the bleſſed Apoſtles, no other foundation, no other to flie to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158688:8"/>for life eternall but Jeſus Chriſt. But in the 4 of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 11. in that glorious Sermon of his, <hi>Peter</hi> in his own name thus ſpeakes concerning Chriſt, <hi>This is the ſtone, which was ſet at naught by you builders, which is become the head of the corner,</hi> neither is there ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other, for <hi>there is no other name under Heaven given amongſt men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> No other foundation therefore of the Church, but Chriſt. And in his firſt Epiſtle the ſecond Chapter the fourth and fift verſes he thus ſpeakes, <hi>To whom comming as unto a living ſtone, diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God, and precious, yee alſo as living ſtones are built up a ſpirituall houſe, &amp;c.</hi> No other foundation for all Chriſtians to be built upon but Chriſt, according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 3. ver. 11. <hi>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the eternall Son of the eternall Father. The ſame is confirmed in the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> verſ. 19, 20. <hi>Now therefore ye are no more ſtrangers, but fellow Citizens, &amp;c. and are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi> So that the foundation of all the Prophets and Apoſtles, and all that ever were ſaved was Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever. Heb.</hi> 13. verſ. 8. the onely Saviour of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the foundation of his Church, <hi>and the onely way, and the truth, and the life,</hi> as he declareth himſelfe in the 14 of <hi>John;</hi> and therefore in his name onely is ſalvation preached amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and to all Nations. And this I thought fit to ſay concerning my meaning of the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I will ſignifie what I underſtand by the terme of building, and to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> This is a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call expreſſion, taken from Architects, and in Gods dialect it is nothing elſe but to believe in Jeſus Chriſt. For as in building the ſtones poliſhed are by cement and morter joyned to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo all believers, thoſe lively ſtones are built upon Jeſus Chriſt, that living ſtone, by faith which joynes them to their head and foundation Chriſt Jeſus; and that onely as <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it in his firſt Epiſtle chap. 2. verſ. 6. <hi>Wherefore it is contained in the holy Scripture. Behold I lay in Sion a chiefe corner ſtone, elect, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he that believes on him ſhall not be confounded. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which believe, he is precious.</hi> So that to be built upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus, by <hi>Peters</hi> own interpretation, is to believe in Jeſus Chriſt for ſalvation, which we cannot doe in any creature without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158688:9"/>blaſphemy. The ſame doctrine is preached by <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> verſ. 5, 6, 7. <hi>For though I be abſent in the fleſh, yet I am with you in the ſpirit, joying and beholding your order, and the ſtedfaſtneſſe of your faith in Chriſt. As ye have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walke ye in him, rooted and built upon him, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, &amp;c.</hi> Here, to be rooted and built up in Chriſt, is to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and by his alone me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to hope for ſalvation, <hi>who was made for us wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. ver. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>and who was made ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and therefore, to be built upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peter</hi> is to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and in him onely for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for there is no other name whereby we may be ſaved. And that this is the true meaning of that metaphoricall expreſſion, may be evidenced by innumerable teſtimonies in holy Scripture, but for the preſent theſe ſhall ſerve, the following diſcourſe will afford us more. But this I thought fit to ſet downe becauſe the termes of my ſyllogiſme being cleared the enſuing diſcourſe will be more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible. And I now come to prove my minor, which was, <hi>that the Church of England was built upon the foundation of Peter.</hi> Which you denied, but by me is thus proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church which acknowledgeth Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the eternall living God, and believeth onely in him for ſalvation, renouncing all merit, wil-worſhip, humane inventions in Gods ſervice, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſtedfaſtly in the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and in the which Church the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt is purely preached, repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and where the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God; That Church is built upon the foundation of Peter, and teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, and is the pillar and ground of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Church of England acknowledgeth Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the eternall living God, and believes onely in him for ſalvation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all merit, wil-worſhip, humane inventions in Gods ſervice, and continues ſtedfaſtly in the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, in which Church the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt is purely preached, repentance towards God, and faith towards the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and where the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is the true invocation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:158688:9"/>
            <p> Ergo, <hi>the Church of England is built upon the foundation of Peter, and teacheth the way, the truth and the life, againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile, and is a true Church, the ground and pillar of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this ſyllogiſme you firſt ſhewed your diſlike, in regard of the length of it, though in very deed conſidering the waightineſſe of the buſineſſe in hand, it being about the way to ſalvation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Church, which ſhewes the path to Heaven, there cannot too much almoſt be ſaid. Secondly, you affirmed that there was not any one portion of thoſe many parts of it, as you expreſt your ſelfe that you could not except againſt. And whereas I ſpake of merit and will-worſhip, you affirmed, if you ſhould ſtand upon the doctrine of merit, the application of it would demand a weeke, but in fine you denied the minor, aſſerting that we did not believe in Jeſus Chriſt as we ſhould and ought to believe; that the Sacraments were not truely and rightly adminiſtred in the Church of England, and then put me upon the proofe of my minor. Which I ſhall by Gods gracious aſſiſtance evidently evince and make good with every part and portion of it, notwithſtanding whatſoever you denied then, or ſhall hereafter be able to gainſay. Uſing therefore the ſame liberty I did formerly, I will firſt explaine, and then confirme the ſeverall parts of my ſyllogiſme, and ſhew not onely the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but the truth of every one of them, and with ſo much the more care and diligence, they being indeed the infallible notes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a true Church, and as I may rightly ſay, the everlaſting markes of the ſame, never deceiving, ſo that whereſoever they be found they are ſo many evidences and charters to confirme the Church to be a true Church where they are, yea any one of them, much more all together will abundantly teſtifie that Church to be the houſe of God, the Church of the living God, the ground and pillar of truth. And that all theſe notes and marks are in the Church of England I ſhall, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> by Gods aſſiſtance (as I ſaid before) elucidately prove, ſo that all your evaſions, capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exceptions, with all your denials will ſpeedily appeare to be groundleſſe and of no validity for the enervating, much leſſe overthrowing of ſo ſolid and grounded a truth.</p>
            <p>The parts therefore of my minor are theſe. Firſt, <hi>That the Church of England doth acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the living God. Secondly, that it doth believe in this Jeſus Chriſt as it ought to believe, in that it doth renounce all merit, will-worſhip, and humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158688:10"/>in Gods ſervice.</hi> Which is the qualification and very effigies of true and ſaving faith, and which is requiſite in any Church to make it a true Church, and without all which indeed it cannot be a true Church. Thirdly, <hi>That it continueth ſtedfaſtly in the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi> Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>that the Goſpell is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached in the Church of England, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Sacraments are rightly there adminiſtred. And that there is the true invocation of God in the Church of England.</hi> Theſe are the parts of my ſyllogiſme, which in order I will explaine and confirme, and ſhew the verity of every one of them in the Church of England. And although I ſhould ſay no more after that, yet it would ſuffice to ſhew the vanity of your exceptions and negation, and confirme the full truth of my whole ſyllogiſme.</p>
            <p>Now to begin with the firſt, viz. <hi>That the Church of England doth acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the eternall living God:</hi> which is eaſily evinced, in whatſoever ſignification the word <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> be taken. Which manner of expreſſion I rather made choice of than of any other, as conceiving it ſubject to leſſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among intelligible and ingenuous men. For to acknowledge any thing is more than a bare knowledge, it being a recognition, the thing being not unknown to him before: but now calling it to memory, or it being brought to his hearing or ſight, upon delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with certainty he doth avouch his knowledge of it. As when a man is charged with a Letter, or any other thing, and it be preſented to his view, and it be demanded of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knowes the Letter or the thing preſented to him, or no? or whether he will owne it? He anſwers, I acknowledge it: that is, he declares to all men, and confeſſeth it to be his owne: here is a knowledge with approbation. So that take the word in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſe it is commonly uſed, either for approving, allowing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, avouching, owning, in all this diverſitie of expreſſions, or if there be any other, the Church of England doth acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt, of whom it hath often heard in the holy Word of God, that he was the beloved Sonne of God, in whom the Lord was well pleaſed; and as in him, ſo for his ſake and merits, with all that ſhall believe in him. And in this notion they acknowledge him, as he is revealed in the holy Scriptures, and ſet forth to <hi>be the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his people from their ſinnes, Matth.</hi> 1. verſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1. to be <hi>that Lambe of God, that takes away the ſinnes of the world, John</hi> 1. verſ. 29. Amongſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158688:10"/>many examples, for the more full illuſtration of the whole matter, theſe few following may ſuffice; as that in the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> 37: where the meſſengers brought <hi>Joſephs</hi> coat to <hi>Jacob</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, verſ. 32.33. <hi>See now</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whether it be thy ſonnes coate, or no.

Another example we have of <hi>Thomas, John</hi> 20. verſ. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. who when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples told him, that Chriſt was riſen, and that <hi>they had ſeen the Lord, be ſaid unto them, Except I ſee his hands, and the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and put my hand into his ſide, I will not believe it. And eight daies after his Diſciples were againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and Thomas with them, then came Jeſus and ſtood in the middeſt, and ſaid, Peace be unto you. After ſaid he to Thomas, put thy finger here, and ſee my hands, &amp;c. and be not faithleſſe, but faithfull. Then Thomas anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſaid unto him, My Lord and my God. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou beleiveſt: bleſſed are they that have not ſeen and have believed. Thomas</hi> knew well that Chriſt was wounded, but when he ſaw the wounds, then he acknowledged as well his owne infidelity, as, that Chriſt was his Lord and his God, and in expreſſe words avoucheth his knowledge with certainty. Here the ſtory of the Samaritans <hi>John</hi> 4. may have place, who believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw Chriſt, by the womans relation of him, that he was the Meſſiah; but they believed much more after they had both ſeen and heard him, and did publikely acknowledge him to <hi>be the Chriſt the Saviour of the World,</hi> verſ. 41. This Chriſt doth the Church of England, though they have neither heard nor ſeen him, believe in, and know, yea with certainty and approbation acknowledge him to be their Lord and their God, and the Saviour of the world: and therefore by Chriſts owne mouth, are proclaimed bleſſed and need feare no mans curſes. Yea the Church of England doth both know and acknowledge this Chriſt, in as ample a manner as humane frailty can attaine to, and publiſh and preach ſalvation onely in his name, according to the holy Scriptures, and will to the laſt drop of their blood acknowledge him to be their Lord and onely redeemer, in the which they are moſt aſſured to find comfort in life and death; and by the power of whoſe might, <hi>to be more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, through him that loved them. Rom.</hi> 7. verſ. 37. and are ſure of life eternall, which Chriſt himſelfe hath promiſed to them that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158688:11"/>know him. <hi>John</hi> 17. ver. 3. <hi>This is life eternall,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that they know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Chap. 53. ver. 11. <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall be are their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> That Church therefore in the which the knowledge of the onely true God and of Jeſus Chriſt is diligently, fully, and ſincerely taught unto the people, and where Chriſt is received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by them, to be the eternall Sonne of God, and the redeemer of the world: that Church is a true Church, and is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believes as it ought to believe. But in the Church of England the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, is knowne, acknowledged, taught, and publiſhed in as ample a manner as is above ſpecified, as all men can witneſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter, &amp;c.</hi> And thus much, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> ſhall ſerve to have ſpoken of the firſt part of my ſyllogiſme, the truth of all which you cannot deny, without wronging your own judgement, and the truth it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the ſecond part, viz <hi>That the Church of England doth believe in Jeſus Chriſt, as it ought to believe,</hi> (which you denied) in that it doth renounce all ſelfe-merit in the worke of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all will-worſhip and humane inventions in Gods ſervice, which is the qualification and very effigies of true and ſaving faith, and which is requiſite in any Church, to make it a true Church, and without which it cannot indeed be a true Church: which will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, when I have deſcribed what is meant by beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt, and renouncing all ſelfe-merit in the matter of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all wil-worſhip &amp; humane inventions in Gods ſervice. But now to begin with believing. To believe in Jeſus Chriſt is nothing elſe but to owne and embrace him, as he is revealed to us in the holy Word of God, for the alone, onely, and perfect Saviour, and to place their whole affiance, confidence and truſt in him onely for ſalvation; and to rely upon him as their onely Redeemer and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Saviour, and that with a certaine and ſolid perſwaſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible aſſurance, according to that of Saint <hi>Peter, John</hi> 6. ver. 68. <hi>&amp;</hi> 69. <hi>Lord to whom ſhall we goe? Thou haſt the words of eternall life. And we believe and are ſure, that thou art the Chriſt the Sonne of the living God.</hi> Here was a certaine and unmoveable aſſurance in the Apoſtles, which did evidence the truth of their faith. Such was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. ver. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Who againſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158688:11"/>hope believed in hope, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>being not weake in faith, &amp;c. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeliefe, but was ſtrong in faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving glory to God. And being fully perſwaded that what he had promiſed he was able to performe. And therefore it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him who raiſed up Jeſus from the dead. Who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed againe for our juſtification.</hi> In this place we may take notice of the Patriarch <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, whoſe example was ſet down for our imitation, that as he believed and gave glory to God by his faith: ſo ſhould we. Now conſider, I pray, the variety of the holy Apoſtles expreſſion in ſetting downe <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith. <hi>Who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>againſt hope believed in hope. He was not weake in the faith. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbeliefe: but was ſtrong in the faith, and fully perſwaded.</hi> Here are very glorious praiſes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and indeed the praiſe of the faith of the Saints of old was this, that they were certainly aſſured. So we read <hi>Luke</hi> 1. verſ. 1. <hi>Whereof we are fully perſwaded, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. verſ. 34. <hi>And yee tooke the ſpoyling of your goods with joy, knowing in your ſelves you had in Heaven a better and induring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> So in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 2. <hi>Behold now are we the ſonnes of God, and it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> In all the Saints we finde an infallible aſſurance and an undaunted and unremoveable confidence in Jeſus Chriſt, who they believed <hi>was delivered for their offences, and raiſed againe for their juſtification, knowing there was no other name under Heaven, given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, whereby we muſt be ſaved. Acts</hi> 4 ver. 11. And this faith in Jeſus Chriſt, is that, that will ſupport us in all tribulations, and finally ſave us, according to that in St. <hi>John</hi> chap. 3. ver. 14, 15, 16. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſſe; even ſo muſt the Sonne of man be lifted up: that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life. For God ſo loved the world, that be gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And verſ. 18. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned, but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the onely begotten Sonne of God.</hi> And in Chap. 5. ver. 24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that believeth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation: but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> Numberleſſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158688:12"/>might be accumulated out of the holy Scripture, to prove, that only to be the true faith and knowledge of Chriſt, when we do conceive him in ſuch ſort as he is offered of the Father, that is to ſay, clothed with the Goſpell; for faith hath a mutuall relation to the word, and the word to faith, becauſe the word is the fountaine of faith, and the ground of faith, and the mirrour in which faith beholdeth God, as Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>He that believeth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life: and ſhall not come into condemnation: but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> This that I have now ſaid, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> will I hope give ſatisfaction to any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, if not to your ſelfe, that the Church of England belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as it ought to believe, becauſe it regulates the faith of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians according to the word of God, and Chriſt their onely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: and therefore it is an unanſwerable argument, that the Church of England is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> when it joyneth the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and faith in him alone, together; <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſſe, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Rom. 3. v. 25, 26. When therefore, I ſay, the Church of England joyneth the knowledge of God and Chriſt, and faith in them both inſeparably together, and makes daily publication of this ſame doctrine, it is evident that it is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> the ground and pillar of truth, and where ſalvation may be attained unto: for that Church <hi>which ſhall confeſſe with the mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhall believe in their heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, ſhall be ſaved: for with the heart men believe unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation. Rom.</hi> 10. But the Church of England doth all this. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth as it ſhould believe, and is a Church where ſalvation may be found. And had the Church of England, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> but this marke alone, it were enough for ever to ſtop the mouthes of all gainſayers, and prove that it is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believes as it ought to believe.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the qualification, viz. <hi>That the Church of England doth renounce all ſelf-merit in matter of ſalvation, and all will-worſhip and humane inventions in Gods ſervice, which are requiſites in any Church to make it a true Church, and without which it cannot be a true Church.</hi> You may remember, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> when you heard the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158688:12"/>name of merit and will-worſhip you began to beſtir your ſelfe, as if it had ſomething troubled you: and it doth indeed highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne you to looke about you, leſt falling upon the rocke of your owne merits, you daſh your ſelfe in pieces, and deſtroy your owne ſoule. And you affirmed, that if you ſhould ſpeake of the doctrine of merits; it would laſt you a weeke. Truely, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if you ſhould ſpeake a moneth, or a yeere together of Chriſts merits, and what he hath done and ſuffered for the redemption of mankind, I ſhould willingly be your anditor, and think that nothing ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough could be uttered or expreſſed to magnifie Gods and Chriſts love, and to ſtirre up thankfulneſſe, obedience, and love to God and Chriſt againe, for their infinite mercy towards us, ſuch miſerable creatures as we poore men are. But, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if you ſhall ſpeake but one minute of an houre to extoll mans merit, or to preach that men by their good workes can or may merit Heaven; or if you goe about to eſtabliſh that blaſphemous doctrin (for it is no better) you ſhall have juſt cauſe to repent all the daies of your life, for your ſo doing: for this doctrine tends to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the glorious Goſpell, and the whole worke of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Chriſts ſufferings, and opens an other way to Heaven, than any of the Saints of old knew of, who ever taught that Chriſt onely was <hi>the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> and not mens merits and workes of ſupererogation. Therefore Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that Church that teacheth the free grace and eternall love of God in Jeſus Chriſt unto the people, when we were dead in our ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and that inculcates ſelf-deniall upon all men, and urges them in matter of ſalvation to rely onely upon Chriſt and his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and paſſion, with all his merits, and to follow the guidance of his word, for the manner of his ſervice; and teaches them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all will-worſhip and humane inventions in honouring God: that Church believes as it ought to believe, and teacheth the true way to Heaven, and is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter:</hi> for all theſe things are the neceſſary requiſites for the making of a true Church, as I ſhall (God willing) ſpeedily ſhew. But if I ſhall be more large upon this point, I deſire your pardon: for in my opinion it is a doctrine of as great concernment as any in Religion, and where it is taught, it is a ſure evidence of a true Church. In the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the which, I will prove all I ſhall ſay out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I make the rule of faith.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:158688:13"/>
            <p> All therefore that will believe in Jeſus Chriſt aright, and as hee himſelfe would have them, and be his Diſciples, they muſt <hi>deny themſelves</hi> and renounce all ſelfe-merits; for that is the firſt leſſon he teacheth them, <hi>Mat.</hi> the 16 <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will come after me, let him deny himſelfe, and take up his Croſſe and follow me:</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> the 9. verſ. 23. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and take up his croſſe dayly and follow me.</hi> This leſſon is taught both in the Law and Goſpell, as in the places now cited, and alſo in the 55 of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ver. 6.7. <hi>Seeke yee the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is nigh; let the wicked forſake his wayes, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him returne unto the Lord, and hee will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> By theſe teſtimonies of holy Scripture, we learne, that the firſt ſtep to Heaven, is ſelfe-deniall and renouncing our own merits. This ſelfe-deniall conſiſts of three parts. <hi>The firſt, a meane eſteeme of our ſelves. The ſecond, a dayly taking up of the croſſe. The third, a following of Chriſts example and foote-ſteps, in patient doing and ſuffering, what God would have us.</hi> And this Maſter <hi>Mountague</hi> is not an eaſy leſſon to learne. But now to leave the two latter parts, I will only inſiſt upon the firſt, which is to deny our ſelves; and in ſelf-deniall, three things are requiſite. <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the magnifying of the free grace of God, we ought to be humble, meane and nothing in our own eyes: <hi>for God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble, James</hi> 4. and the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 5. and this was ever the practice of all the Saints. <hi>Abraham</hi> counts himſelfe <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> when hee hath to deale with God. And Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. ſaith, <hi>Learne of me, for I am humble and meeke.</hi> So that all thoſe that have rightly learned this leſſon, have no high and overtowring thoughts and conceits of their owne worth or merits, but lie low and proſtrate before God, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves miſerable ſinners and unprofitable ſervants when they have done that was commanded them, and in a word are <hi>weary and heavy laden. Secondly,</hi> we muſt renounce our own wills and reaſon, and bring them in ſubjection to the will and pleaſure of God; not our owne wills and reaſon therefore, but the will of Chriſt muſt ſuffice us, his wiſdome muſt be our reaſon. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we muſt count all things as dung in compariſon of Chriſt, and for the excellency of the knowledge of him, and ought to eſteeme all things but loſſe, willingly &amp; cheerefully relinquiſhing and forſaking, friends, riches, honours, yea, if neceſſity require, for the cauſe of Chriſt and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158688:13"/>of a good conſcience, we muſt abandon our owne lives, and whatſoever is deareſt unto us, all which cannot conſiſt with the thought of ſelfe-merit; for this leſſon teacheth us humility, and juſt cauſe indeed have all men ſeriouſly and unfainedly to be humble, for if we looke upon all men ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as they are in their naturall condition, we ſhall finde nothing in them but ſinne and corruption, and that they are wicked in all their wayes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in all their thoughts, and therefore they ought to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and to forſake and deny themſelves, and to returne unto the Lord and come unto Chriſt, and be lowly under the mighty hand of God, if they will obtaine mercy, finde pardon and be exalted; this is the firſt leſſon, I ſay we muſt learne. Yea, the very regenerate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the deareſt Saints and Servants of God, whiles they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in this Tabernacle of clay, and till their ſoules be unbodyed, finde themſelves ſo laden with iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne, as they have alwayes matter of humiliation, never of glorying, never of vanting of their own merits, never of boaſting of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but rather of ſeeking another righteouſneſſe, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Heaven, the righteouſneſſe of Faith, which is Chriſts righteouſneſſe, by which they may appeare before God, and this they can never obtaine to, without ſelfe-deniall and renouncing all their own merits.</p>
            <p>But it will not be amiſſe, Maſter <hi>Mountague,</hi> briefely to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all men in their naturall condition, and after their Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that both before the Law, and under the Law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell, and ſee Gods own Teſtimony of them all, and the witneſſe and teſtimony the holieſt men, that ever were, and lived, gave of themſelves, and then it will be cleerely evidenced they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all ſelfe-neſſe and all their own merits, and looked only for ſalvation by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. And firſt let us heare, what God ſaith of all the ſeede of <hi>Adam</hi> before their Regeneration, <hi>Geneſies</hi> the 6 verſ. 5. <hi>and God ſaw that the wickedneſſe of man was great upon the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was only evill continually.</hi> Note here the ſpirit of God doth not ſay, that man hath ſome evill thoughts, or that his thoughts are evill ſometimes: but he aſſerts, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that every imagination, or the whole immagination, purpoſe or deſire of the heart are evill: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that they are evill continually, or every day, alwaies evill, and in the 8. Chap. verſ. 21. he affirmes the ſame, ſaying, <hi>The imagination
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158688:14"/>of mans heart is evill from his youth.</hi> The corruption therefore of all men begins with them from their Cradle, and if God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate us it continues and accompanies us to our grave; and this is the condition of all men before Regeneration, and that before the Law and under the Law, and under the Goſpell. And it could be no otherwiſe by the Teſtimony of <hi>Job.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Who can bring,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a cleane thing out of an uncleane? Not one.</hi> All came of a corrupt ſeede.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth the ſame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſinne did my mother conceive me:</hi> ſuch a generation of men without ſelfe-deniall, and returning from their wicked waies, and forſaking their unrighteous thoughts and imaginations cannot be Chriſts Diſciples. This miſerable condition of mankind, is every where publiſhed through the Scripture, to being men to a more deepe humiliation and abhorring of themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> the 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>The Lord looked downe from Heaven,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any, that did underſtand and ſeeke God. They are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> By this teſtimony, we ſee the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo generall, that the Lord exempteth no man from it. The ſame doctrine is confirmed in the 53 <hi>Pſal.</hi> and in this condition, do all men continue, till they are regenerated, and begot anew: for ſo long as they are in their naturall eſtate, and till they are in Chriſt, they can do nothing pleaſing unto God, nor bring forth any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> the 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>yee can do nothing. For the wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, or <hi>the minding of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>is enmity againſt God: for it is not ſubiect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law of God, neither indeede can be.</hi> The Apoſtle ſays not only, that the wiſdome of the fleſh, is not ſubject, unto the Law of God but that it cannot be. And in the firſt of the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. the ſecond the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the naturall man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe to him, neither can hee know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Now, if the unregenerate man, in his ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and naturall condition, cannot know and ſo much as diſcerne the things of the Spirit, the things of God, how much leſſe can he do the things, that God commands? Therefore before Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>hee is dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, following the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and is by nature the child of wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2.3. and this is the condition of all men before Regeneration. Now, if
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158688:14"/>they be dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, and follow the luſts of the fleſh, there is no life in them, to that which is good, before they be raiſed from the grave of ſin, which will never be, before they forſake their own wayes, and their own thoughts, and deny themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is a knowne truth, ratified by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and confirmed by the Teſtimony of all orthodox Writers, <hi>that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Now, all men in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition, are without faith, <hi>they are without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Common-Wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the World. Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and therefore in a ſad, deplorable, and deſperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo long as they continue and abide in their corrupt nature, and are not ſanctifyed by grace, for without faith they cannot pleaſe God, or do any good workes: <hi>for whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. And this is the naturall condition of all mankind, before the Law, and under the Law, and under the Goſpell, as by all theſe, and innumerable more witneſſes might be evinced. And therefore all naturall men muſt deny themſelves and renounce all, if they will be Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Yea the very regenerate muſt learne this Leſſon of ſelfe-deniall, and renounce all their owne merits and all their owne workes, or they cannot be Chriſts Diſciples. The Saints of old knew that Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very well, and therefore they never boaſted of their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, or of their own merits, or good works; that was Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall, <hi>who truſted in themſelves, that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeakes of them <hi>Luke</hi> the 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. &amp; 11.12. <hi>The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe, God I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the weeke, and give Tithes of all that I poſſeſſe.</hi> They were alſo frequent in Almes-deeds, ſo that if workes either of the ceremoniall, judiciall, and morall Law could have juſtifyed any, or brought them to Heaven, the Phariſees might as well by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have challenged Heaven, as any juſticiaries in this Age, who come far ſhort of their righteouſneſſe. And yet our Saviour Chriſt ſaith of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Except your righteouſneſſe exceede the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, yee ſhall in no caſe enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> I ſay therefore, the Saints and Servants of God in all ages, were ſo farre from preſuming of their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or challenging of Heaven by their good workes, that wee finde

But let us take notice, what God ſpeakes of ſome of them, and how honourably, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be towards this people; caſt them out of my ſight.</hi> And in Ezekiel <hi>the</hi> 14. verſ. 20. <hi>Though</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in it, as I live ſaith the Lord God, they ſhall deliver neither ſonne nor daughter, they ſhall deliver but their owne ſoules, by their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Theſe were men, all of them, in high favour with God, who giveth them here a glorious teſtimony, as in many other places in holy Scripture, of righteouſneſſe, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> the 12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> the 3. he commends <hi>Moſes for his faithfulneſſe in his houſe, and of</hi> Job <hi>hee ſaith</hi> Job 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Haſt thou conſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evill?</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the 28 <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. he commends <hi>Daniel</hi> for his wiſdom, and in the firſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> the 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. of <hi>David</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that hee was a man according to his own heart.</hi> And yet, if we looke upon all theſe men, we ſhall finde them confeſſing and beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people, and never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of their owne righteouſneſſe, nor vanting of their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but ever denying themſelves, as in the 90 <hi>Pſal. verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Moſes</hi> there ſayes, <hi>thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſinnes in the ſight of thy Countnance,</hi> and verſ. 13. <hi>returne O Lord, how long?</hi> Here, we finde confeſſion of ſinne and deprecation of judgement, even in <hi>Moſes. Daniel</hi> alſo confeſſeth his ſinnes and the ſinnes of the people, and deprecates Gods judgements, <hi>Daniel,</hi> the 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. and <hi>David</hi> in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158688:16"/>the 19 <hi>Pſal.</hi> ver. 13. ſaith, <hi>Who can underſtand his errors? Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes.</hi> So that it is evident, that beſides the ſinnes the Saints know of themſelves, there are many they take no notice of, and therefore ought with <hi>David</hi> ever to make this prayer, Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes; ſo that there can never be matter of merit, where there are ſecret ſinnes. And <hi>Job</hi> 9. ver. 20. <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelfe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my owne mouth ſhall condemne me. If I ſay, I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe.</hi> We ſee nothing of merit in all the Saints. Here I might bring in the prayers of all the Patriarchs, of all the Prophets, of all the Apoſtles and Saints of old, of the which the holy Scripture is full, and in all of them they confeſſe their owne ſinnes, and the ſinnes of the people, and ever deprecate Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, never pretending or preſuming of their owne worth or merits, or challenging favour for them, from God; but proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and humbly denying themſelves: yea, in plaine words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes they proclaime themſelves and all men, even the moſt regenerate, wicked and abominable, and diſavow their owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, confeſſing that it is an uncleane thing, and looke for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at Gods hand, onely through Jeſus Chriſt, their righteouſneſſe. But let us heare the teſtimonies now, that both the Prophets and Apoſtles gave of themſelves, and of all the family of the faithfull; and what Chriſt himſelfe taught us, who knew beſt what was in man after regeneration. In the firſt of <hi>Kings</hi> and the 8. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith there, <hi>There is no man that ſinneth not.</hi> And in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. ver. 20. he ſaith, <hi>There is not a juſt man upon the earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. ver. 9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart cleane from my ſinne?</hi> Not the moſt righteous man, and moſt holy. Heare what <hi>Job</hi> alſo witneſſeth concerning th buſineſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 9. ver. 2, 3. <hi>How ſhall a man be juſt with God? if he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> And of all the ſinnes that come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, there is not the leaſt, that deſerves not eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being committed againſt an eternall Majeſty. How farre then, in <hi>Jobs</hi> eſteeme, are men from compleat and perfect righteouſneſſe? Yea how farre then are they from meriting? and in chap. 15. v. 14, 15, 16. <hi>What is man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, that he ſhould be cleane? and he that is borne of woman, that he ſhould be righteous? behold, he hath no truſt in his Saints; yea the Heavens are not cleare in his ſight: how much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</hi> From all theſe places and many more, it may well be concluded, that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158688:17"/>the very regenerate have ſinne ſtill remaining in them, and through the corruption of their nature that ever abides and continues in them, are inclined alwaies to that which is evill, and are unapt to all that is good, and can never attaine to compleat and perfect righteouſneſſe, but have continuall need with <hi>David,</hi> to pray, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight no fleſh ſhall be juſtified. Pſalm.</hi> 143. ver. 2. There are two ſorts of juſtification or righteouſneſſe: the one before men, and that is manifeſted by our workes: and the other is before God, and that cannot by any works of ours be attained to: as by a cloud of witneſſes might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. See therefore what <hi>David</hi> ſaith againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. ver. 3. <hi>If thou, O Lord, ſhouldſt marke iniquity, O Lord who ſhould ſtand? but there is forgiveneſſe with thee that thou mayſt be feared;</hi> Here is no preſumption of merit, but confidence of mercy. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 64. ver. 6. in the name of all the faithfull and regenerate, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowes all merits, and diſclaimes all their owne righteouſneſſe, in theſe words, <hi>But we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are all as an uncleane thing, and all our righteouſneſſe as filthy rags, and we all doe fade as a leafe, and our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties like the wind have taken us away.</hi> The Prophet doth not ſay here, that all our unrighteouſneſſe, but all our righteouſneſſe; teaching all men thereby, that the eyes of the Lord behold faults, failings, and blemiſhes, in the very beſt, moſt perfect, and holieſt actions, and in the which we moſt earneſtly deſire to pleaſe God. And this is the doctrine the holy Prophet teaches all men, to humble them the more, and to bring them to a loathing and abominating of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to manifeſt unto them that there is no perfection or abſolute righteouſneſſe in the Saints themſelves, and in the moſt holy men, ſuch as may juſtifie them before God, but that there is alwaies matter of humiliation, and of ſelf-denyall in them: for as long as they are but in the race, and as long as they remaine in the fleſh <hi>they cannot doe the good they would.</hi> So ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5. verſ. 7. <hi>For the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other: ſo that ye cannot doe the things that ye would.</hi> This inward combat continues as long as we live, and that, in all the Saints: and therefore they can never attain unto perfection in this life, and therefore can never merit. Yea, the holy Apoſtles continually acknowledge it, confeſſing their owne ſinfulneſſe, and failings, teaching all the faithfull to doe the ſame. So St. <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple, in his firſt Epiſtle chap. 1. verſ. 8.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158688:17"/>
               <hi>If we ſay, we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> alſo chap. 3. ver. 2. ſaith, <hi>In many things we ſinne all.</hi> Here he excepts no mortall man; all have their ſinnes, and have need of ſelf-deniall. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo that elect veſſell grones under the burden of ſin, and with griefe and ſorrow acknowledges his continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with the remainders of his corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ver. 22, 23, 24. <hi>I delight,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Law of God, after the inward man: but I ſee another law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſinne, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? I thanke God, through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, &amp;c. Paul</hi> had learned this leſſon of ſelf-denyall, acknowledging his ſinnes, and making his recourſe unto Chriſt, for pardon and deliverance from it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no other name under Heaven to be ſaved by, and ſo he becomes Chriſts Diſciple, as all other ſinners if they will be ſaved muſt doe: and that we are ſinners, and can never in this world at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto an abſolute perfection, and to a full and intire keeping and fulfilling of the Law, the places I have now quoted, and the ſeverall witneſſes of all the Saints, and the very prayer our Saviour himſelfe hath taught us, doe ſufficiently teſtifie, where we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed daily to ſay, <hi>forgive us our ſinnes. Luke</hi> 11. ver. 4. Now where there is no offence, there is no need of pardon: but all the Saints as long as they live have need of pardon; therefore as long as they live they are ſinfull, and have need of ſelf-denyall and of true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and a meane eſteeme of themſelves, and a renouncing of all their owne righteouſneſſe, if they will be Chriſts diſciples, and if they expect ſalvation by him: for they muſt have it upon his owne <hi>conditions:</hi> for he will be ſaviour to none, to whom he is not their Lord; he will be obeyed, and have his pleaſure ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, or elſe we cannot be his diſciples, nor obtaine life eternall. So that inevitably, and moſt neceſſarily it followeth, that we muſt renounce our owne merits, and juſtification by our owne workes, if we will believe in Chriſt as we ought to believe. All which when the Church of England teacheth, it is built <hi>upon the foundation of Peter:</hi> and therefore is a true <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that I may conclude this point, and clearely evidence the truth of it to you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> and all men, and by other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies confirme it, and in ſo doing, prove the Church of England a true Church, (which you ſtifly deny) I will briefly declare, wherein
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158688:18"/>our juſtification before God conſiſteth, and what it is that makes us acceptable with him, and to believe aright, which is not to rely upon our own righteouſnes, but upon the righteouſnes of Jeſus Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by faith. And this doctrin we learn out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which teach us a twofold righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. v. 3. a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, and a righteouſneſſe of our owne, which the Jewes relying upon, as all Juſticiaries do, <hi>did not ſubmit themſelves to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God,</hi> &amp; therefore did not deny themſelves and come unto Chriſt, &amp; rely upon him, <hi>Who was the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe, to every one that believeth,</hi> verſ. 4. For, <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man that doth thoſe things ſhall live by them. But the righteouſneſſe which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, that if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation.</hi> Here faith alone is the hand that reacheth forth the righteouſnes of Chriſt unto us, and by which apprehending Chriſt we ſtand juſtified before God. So that, out of the words of the Apoſtle this twofold righteouſneſſe appeares; the righteouſneſſe of the Goſpell and the righteouſneſſe of the Law, which the Apoſtle ſo deſcribeth, as no mortall man ever living, beſides Chriſt onely, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> was righteous or juſt, or indeed could be, as is ſufficiently by the places above mentioned, proved. But, the righteouſnes of the Goſpell is, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in Chriſt ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. John</hi> 3. <hi>For the juſt ſhall live by his faith. Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. Now then, when the righteouſneſſe of the Law, conſiſteth in the abſolute and perfect obſervation, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and fulfilling of the whole Law; and no man can perfectly keepe, obſerve and obey it, it of neceſſity followes, that we cannot attaine unto righteouſneſſe by the Law, but we muſt ſeeke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther righteouſneſſe, which is onely to be found in the Goſpell, and that righteouſneſſe is the remiſſion of all our ſinnes, and our reconciliation with God, and the imputation of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe freely beſtowed upon us of God, for Chriſts ſake, who is our onely Saviour and redeemer. And this is to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> And this is the righteouſneſſe by which we muſt be ſaved and juſtified before God. <hi>For we are juſtified freely by grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Rom.</hi> chap. 3. ver. 24. and in verſ. 28. farther expreſſeth himſelfe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:158688:18"/>ſaying, <hi>We conclude therefore, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> The ſenſe and meaning of the which words, if we do duely conſider them, will ſo cleare unto all men this Evangelicall and everlaſting truth, that there will be no doubting of it to any rationall creature. For the finding out therefore of the true ſenſe of theſe words, three things offer themſelves to be deliberated on. <hi>Firſt, what is meant here by being juſtified. Secondly, what is meant, to be juſtified by faith. Thirdly, what are thoſe works and deeds which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the firſt, we are to obſerve three diſtinct actions of God in it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the freedome &amp; abſolution of a ſinner from the guilt of his ſins and iniquities for the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. v. 38, 39. <hi>Be it knowne unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſins. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes.</hi> That is, by Jeſus Chriſt they are freed and abſolved from the guilt of thoſe ſinnes which the Law could not free them from. And in this ſenſe doth the Apoſtle oppoſe juſtification to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. v. 33. which is nothing elſe, but a binding over a man to undergoe the due and deſerved puniſhment. The ſecond action of God, is imputation, or the eſteeming, or the accounting of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as juſt, for the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Woe be to him that juſtifieth the wicked, Eſay</hi> 5. ver. 22. that is, that doth not make him juſt, but accompts, eſteems, and declares him as juſt. So in the Goſpell <hi>wiſdom is ſaid to be juſtified of her children:</hi> that is approved of, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. The third action of God, is the acceptation or receiving of a ſinner to life eternall in Chriſt. For after God hath freed and abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſinner, and imputed righteouſneſſe unto him, this receiving of him after that, to life eternall, doth neceſſarily follow, which is therefore cald <hi>juſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5. ver. 18. where the reaſon of it is likewiſe rendered: for as <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne and offence, was imputed to all, or came upon all, and by it death entered into the world and reigned: ſo the obedience of Chriſt being imputed to all believers, they are made righteous and obtaine juſtification of life. From the conſideration of all which, this definition of juſtification is eaſily gathered: <hi>That it is an action of God the Father, abſolving and freeing a ſinner from all his offences and tranſgreſſions, for the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and imputing righteouſneſſe unto him, and receiving of him to life eternall.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:158688:19"/>
            <p> And now I come to the ſecond thing, viz. <hi>What is meant, to be juſtified by faith.</hi> The ſenſe and meaning of the which, as it is a matter of great moment and conſequence, and concernes no leſſe than our eternall happineſſe: ſo it cals for and requires at our hands all care and diligence for the right underſtanding of it, which the great Rabbins of the Church of Rome are ignorant of; and that it may the more eaſily be delucidated and underſtood, I will declare <hi>firſt,</hi> what that thing is, for which a ſinner is juſtified, and accounted juſt. And that is the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt our mediator and redeemer, and that both his active and paſſive; (for thoſe are not to be ſeparated that God hath joyned together) the laſt of which doth conſiſt in Chriſts ſuffering of the firſt death, in reſpect of his body; and the induring of the dolours, pangs, and ſorrowes of the ſecond death, in reſpect of his ſoule: the firſt of which doth conſiſt in his perfect fulfilling of the law for us. The truth of which doth evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. For after the fall of our firſt parents, all man-kind ſtood bound in a double debt; we had violated and broken the law, and therefore were all tyed and bound firſt to make ſatisfaction for that. Secondly, as we are creatures we were ſtill bound to keepe and fulfill the whole Law, even to the rigour of it, and to doe whatſoever that commanded: of the which double debt, when we were not able to pay the leaſt portion (being now become bankrupts of that primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall and originall righteouſneſſe, and wholly corrupted) we muſt neceſſarily have recourſe and flie to our ſurety and mediator, who hath diſcharged both thoſe debts for us. The firſt he payd for us being dead in our ſinnes and treſpaſſes, when he was made a curſe for us, and ſo redeemed us from the curſe and malediction of the law, though not from the obedience of it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. ver. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. ver. 24, 25. and in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ver. 21. The laſt he performed by his perfect obedience to the whole law, ſo that in Jeſus Chriſt we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law. The ſecond thing to be here conſidered, for the better underſtanding of this buſineſſe of ſo great concernment, is, ſeeing that the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt is the matter of our juſtification, and that is without us, and none of ours; how that comes to be made ours, which being once declared, the truth then will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. That the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt therefore may be made ours, it muſt firſt be given to us of God. Secondly, we muſt receive and imbrace this righteouſneſſe. Now, God gives us this righteouſneſſe when he gives Chriſt unto us, for with Chriſt this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158688:19"/>righteouſneſſe is beſtowed upon us, and it is then made ours when God out of his infinite mercy accounts it, and judgeth it ours: and it is made ours onely by imputation, as it is evident and manifeſt by theſe reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> as Chriſt was made ſinne for us, <hi>ſo we are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ver. 21. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. v. 30. Now Chriſt was made ſinne for us onely by imputation, therefore the inherent righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt is made ours onely by imputation. Secondly, as the diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> was made ours, ſo the obedience of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is made ours, as it is largely diſcourſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. ver. 17.18. but the offence and diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> was made ours by imputation: therefore after the ſame manner Chriſts obedience is made ours. Secondly, that Chriſts obedience may be made ours, we muſt receive it and apply it to our ſelves, and put it on, which is onely done by faith the hand of the ſoule, for the receiving of thoſe things which are given us of God. Whereby the way, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I deſire you to take notice, that a ſinner is not juſtified for the dignity of faith, but as it is an inſtrument by which the obedience of Chriſt is applied to the ſoule.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the third thing, viz. <hi>What works and deeds are excluded from juſtification?</hi> And for anſwer, I affirme, all the works of the ceremoniall and morall law: and all the workes of nature and grace; which is thus proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. ver. 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight: for by the law is the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> Here all deeds of the law, both ceremoniall and morall, are excluded from juſtification, and that by an excellent and unanſwerable argument of the Apoſtle. That which diſcovers the knowledge of ſinne, and accuſes us for it, that cannot juſtifie us before God. And for farther proofe of it, in the 28 verſe, the place I firſt cited, is plain, <hi>Therfore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the works or deeds of the law.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. ver. 15, 16. <hi>We who are Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the workes of the law: for by the workes of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Here, by the workes of the law we cannot underſtand, the workes that men doe in the ſtate of nature and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and before regeneration: ſeeing, the Apoſtle writes unto the Church of the Galatians, that had received the Goſpell of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:158688:20"/>Jeſus Chriſt, and were believers, the Apoſtle alſo includes him himſelfe amongſt them, ſaying, <hi>We alſo, &amp;c.</hi> and in the 21. verſe, <hi>I doe not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righteouſneſſe came by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vaine.</hi> So that if men can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law, it followeth that they have no need of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; but they have need of Jeſus Chriſt: therefore all the workes of the Law are excluded from juſtification, even in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. But for more full proof, chap. 3. ver. 10. <hi>For as many as are under the workes of the Law are under the curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to doe them, Deut.</hi> 27.26. Here by the Law, is underſtood the whole Law of God, for it comprehends all that is written in the booke of the Law, as in expreſſe words the Apoſtle ſhewes; but principally the morall Law, as is evident by that paſſage cited by the Apoſtle out of the Law; ſo that it is cleere and apparent, that all thoſe that pretend or preſume to be juſtified by the workes of the Law are under this fearefull malediction and curſe; and in the 11. verſe, by an invincible reaſon he confirmeth the former truth, in theſe words, <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the Law, in the ſight of God, is evident: for the juſt ſhall live by faith. Hab.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. The argument of the Apoſtle is this, That by which we have life, juſtifies us before God; but by faith we have life: <hi>ergo,</hi> by faith <hi>alone, we are juſtified before God.</hi> And in the 12. verſe, <hi>And the Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is not of faith, but the man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Here it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, there are two waies of attaining eternall life, or two waies of juſtification; the one by the exact accompliſhing, keeping, and fulfilling of the whole Law, which no mortall man hath yet ever done, Chriſt excepted; the other by faith imbracing the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed up for our juſtification. Rom.</hi> 4. ver. 25. and in the 13. verſe, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, &amp;c.</hi> and in chap. 5. ver. 4. <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect unto you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law; yee are falne from grace.</hi> All thoſe therefore that will be juſtified by the works of the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt: but the Church of Rome doth this, Mr. <hi>Montague: ergo.</hi> But for the Church of England it followeth the Apoſtles example, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ver. 8, &amp; 9. <hi>Counting all things loſſe, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and that it may be found in him, not having its owne righteouſneſſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158688:20"/>which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith.</hi> By the which righteouſneſſe of Chriſt all the workes of the Law are excluded from juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>But I will yet more fully prove, that the workes of grace are alſo excluded from juſtification. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. ver. 8, 9. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Here againe all workes are removed; withall, we may obſerve, that the holy Apoſtle in this place a fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that we are not ſaved by workes, ſpeakes not of thoſe workes before grace and regeneration, according to the ordinary evaſion of the Church of Rome, but he ſpeakes of all the workes men doe in the ſtate of grace, and after converſion, and which ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany us as we preſſe to the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, as we may ſee in the 10. verſe. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good workes, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walke in them.</hi> So that good workes are not the meritorious cauſe, of the Kingdome of Heaven, but onely the way which God hath prepared and appointed for us to walke in to Heaven. And in the 11. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> ver. 6, 7. he ſaith, <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of workes, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi> He ſpeakes here of the regenerate Romans, and of the workes dond by them after their converſion, which he excludes from juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and therefore it is a poore evaſion or quillet of the Church of Rome to excuſe their pride, when they ſay, that God hath given us the grace of meriting, which is a flat contradiction: for grace doth ever exclude merit, as the words of <hi>Paul</hi> inferre, who ſaith, <hi>If it be by grace, then not of workes; and if of workes, then it is no more grace, otherwiſe worke is no more worke.</hi> And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> ch. 3. ver. 4, 5. <hi>But after,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the kindneſſe and love of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards man appeared, not by workes of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.</hi> Here the Apoſtle includes himſelfe in the number of the regenerate, as in all the other places, and diſavowes all workes, and excludes them from juſtification: for the mercy and grace of God cannot ſtand with mens merits, as hath been ſufficiently already proved. And in that verſe he further addes, <hi>that being juſtified by grace, we ſhould be made heires according to the hope of eternall life.</hi> From which words we learne, that we have life eternall as heires of God, and not in the way &amp; quality of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:158688:21"/>So that by all theſe proofes it is evident that all workes are excluded from juſtification, as by many reaſons alſo may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. For ſinners are and ought ſo to be juſtified before God, that all occaſion of gloriation and boaſting may be taken away, as we ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. ver. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is taken away. By what Law?</hi> of workes? <hi>Nay, but by the law of faith.</hi> Now if a man by the workes of grace might be juſtified, he ſhould then have ſomething whereof to glory, notwithſtanding he acknowledged he received thoſe workes from God, as we may ſee in the example of the Phariſee in the 18. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and ſhould alſo have more to glory of than <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. ver. 3, 4. where it is ſaid, <hi>that if Abraham be juſtified by workes, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God. For what ſaith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Againe, if a man be juſtified by workes, then the juſtification of the Law ſhould ſtand, and be of force; but that ſtands not, as by all the teſtimonies before mentioned is evident, and from the 14. verſe of this chapter, <hi>For if they which are of the Law be heires, faith is made void, and the promiſe made of no effect.</hi> And not onely this verſe, but the tenour of the whole chapter proves that <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he abounded in good workes, yet was juſtified before God, without the workes of the Law; howſoever before men, according to that of St. <hi>James</hi> chap. 2. He declared by his workes, the livelineſſe of his faith, for St. <hi>James</hi> himſelfe ſaith, verſ. 23. <hi>That Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe: and he was called the friend of God.</hi> And that was long before he offered his Sonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God by his works, it cannot be underſtood of the works of the ceremoniall Law, which was not given till foure hundred yeares after the juſtification of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the principall things we may gather out of this whole fourth chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> are theſe. Firſt, that the workes of grace, and after regeneration, are excluded from juſtificaton. Secondly, that the juſtification of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the father of the faithfull, is the modell and patterne of the juſtification of all believers, and ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appeares from the 22. and 23. verſes, <hi>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him who raiſed up Jeſus from the dead.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified before God by faith, without the workes of the law, ſo all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:158688:21"/>believers are juſtified, which the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, chap. 3. ver. 8. doth againe clearely prove. <hi>And the Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpell unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed: ſo that they which be of faith are bleſſed with faithfull Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> And from this very place it is manifeſt, that <hi>Abraham</hi> then believed, when the Apoſtle affirmes that he was not juſtified before God by his workes, to confirme unto us likewiſe, that we are not juſtified before God by our workes, after that God hath given unto us faith. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> evidences the ſame by his owne example, and by the example of the faithfull, that the works of grace alſo are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from juſtification, for in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 4. ver. 4. <hi>I know nothing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by my ſelfe, yet am I not hereby juſtified.</hi> Here the Apoſtle declares two things concerning himſelfe: The firſt, his good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The ſecond, that he was not thereby juſtified. By which, all the workes of grace are excluded from juſtification. Yea, it is moſt evident, that a man muſt be juſtified before he can doe any good workes, or any thing pleaſing unto God: ſo that thoſe workes that follow juſtification, can no way effect it, or be the cauſe of it. And as all workes are excluded, ſo all vertues, faith onely excepted: for as he that receives a gift, puts forth his hand onely, but after he has received it, not onely his hand, but his tongue, and his feet, and his other members, which conferred nothing in the receiving, teſtifie their thankfulneſſe. After the ſame manner, we receive the matter of juſtification, by faith onely, the hand of the ſoule, not by hope or charity. But after Chriſt is received and imbraced, theſe graces likewiſe manifeſt themſelves, with all the reſt, which ſpring from faith, the fountaine that ſanctifies, cleanſes, and purifies the heart, ſprinkling it with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, from which fountaine ariſe all the ſtreams of all other ſaving graces that appear in our lives. And this, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> is the ſaving doctrine of juſtification, which when the Church of England ſo firmely holdeth forth, declares, and preaches, it believeth in Jeſus Chriſt as it ought to believe, and is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> when it excludes all merits and workes from juſtification, and lookes for ſalvation in Chriſt by faith alone; for which its believing it hath very good reaſon; for if the children of Iſrael did not by their owne righteouſneſſe merit the Land of Canaan, which is by God himſelfe there excluded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. which was but the type, how much leſſe can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:158688:22"/>any man by his merits merit Heaven it ſelfe, which is the thing typified.</p>
            <p>But that I may neither leave you, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> nor any Romaniſt any ground of cavill, I ſhall by your patience ſay ſomething here ſeverally and by it ſelf, to a poore objection that is often made by the Papiſts againſt our doctrine of free juſtification by faith alone, who often conteſt, that in the whole Scripture, it is no where ſaid, that man is juſtified by faith alone; that particle <hi>alone,</hi> ſay they, is no where inſerted in the holy Scripture, but is onely put in by us. But for anſwer, I deſire you to take notice, that howſoever that particle in ſo many letters be not in expreſſe terms ſpecified, there is in many places of the Scripture that ſet downe, that that is equivalent to it, as will by and by appeare. And however, I ſay, that word <hi>alone</hi> be not in the Scriptures, notwithſtanding the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth clearely confirme our opinion of free juſtification by faith alone, ſo that no man can doubt of it, that hath not reſigned his reaſon, and ſo evidently declares it, as if he had in expreſſe words ſaid, by <hi>faith alone.</hi> For faith beholds and lookes upon ſomething without us, that is the mercy and favour of God promiſed in a mediator, which are the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> and this mercy <hi>alone</hi> doth juſtifie us; and this mercy doth faith <hi>alone</hi> apprehend; wherefore the name of faith taken by it ſelfe, denoteth as much as faith <hi>alone,</hi> and by it ſelfe. Beſides, <hi>Paul</hi> in this buſineſſe and worke of juſtification joynes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with faith, and therefore he teacheth that faith alone doth ſuffice: for if it hath nothing joyned and coupled with it, in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or abſolving of us, then it is plaine and evident that faith alone doth juſtifie us. For whatſoever could adde or conferre any thing to our juſtification, all that is removed and excluded from faith in our juſtification. For what is it Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I pray, thinke you, that in this cauſe or buſineſſe ſhould be joyned with faith? I preſume you will ſay workes. Now then, if workes be removed, ſevered, and disjoyned from faith, and that in expreſſe words, it followes then neceſſarily, that we are juſtified by faith alone. Heare then I pray, what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. verſ. 28. <hi>We therefore conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith, without the deeds of the Law.</hi> And in the ſame chapter, verſ. 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> And verſ. 24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by grace, through the redemption of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in chap. 4. ver. 5, 6. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158688:22"/>is imputed for righteouſneſs, even as</hi> David <hi>alſo deſcribes the bleſsedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi> And in his epiſtle to the <hi>Gala.</hi> cap. the 2.16. <hi>knowing that a man is not juſtified by the workes of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> I beſeech you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> tell me ingenuouſly, what could be ſpoke or cited more cleerly for the confirming of our opinion and doctrine? For if wee be not juſtified by the workes of the Law; and if we be not juſtified, but <hi>by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and if all workes of the Law be ſo often by the Apoſtle excluded from juſtification, and twice in expreſſe tearmes, removed from juſtification, in this verſe, and that with an irriſiſtible reaſon added by the Apoſtle, ſhewing the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of juſtification by workes, ſaving <hi>that by the workes of the Law ſhall no fleſh be iuſtified,</hi> I ſay in all theſe regards, it neceſſarily followes, that we are juſtified by faith alone. And we may adde to all this, what the Apoſtle often ſpeakes, that <hi>wee are juſtified freely, it is the gift of God,</hi> which excludes all reaſon of merit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>for by grace are yee ſaved, through faith: and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of workes, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> if all that I have ſpoke, cannot yet ſatisfy you, I hope it will ſatisfy all rationall men; and it doth abundantly confirme me in this truth: and alſo prove, that that Church which teacheth the free grace of God, and the doctrin of juſtification by faith alone in Jeſus Chriſt, is a true Church, and believes as it ought to believe. But before I draw to an end, and couclude this point, I ſhall at your beſt leiſure deſire you to anſwer this Argument. <hi>If wee be not juſtified by the workes of the Law; if to him that workes not, but believeth on him that juſtifies the ungodly, his faith is imputed for righteouſneſſe: if by the workes of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified: if Righteouſneſſe without workes be imputed: if freely; if by grace; if it be the gift of God:</hi> and to conclude, <hi>if we be not juſtified, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt: Then we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Faith alone. But the antecedent is true, therefore the conſequent.</hi> Wherefore then ſhould any man cavill againſt our Doctrine of free juſtification by faith alone, becauſe the particle <hi>alone</hi> is not in expreſſe tearmes ſet down, when there are divers expreſſions of as full efficacy and as prevalent to declare the truth of that tenent, as if indeed that word had been expreſſed? Notwithſtanding all that I have now ſaid, to prove the doctrine of free juſtification by faith alone, to bee grounded upon the Scripture, and that according to the holy Word of God, the Church of <hi>England</hi> preacheth it: and by that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158688:23"/>proves it ſelfe a true Church: yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not teach, that, that faith by which we are juſtified, is alone or ſolitary without the company and fellowſhip of good workes, and other vertues and graces which are the fruits of faith: but urgeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe and teacheth all holy duties to be joyned with Faith (as wee ſhall ſee afterwards) and that wee ſhould be abounding in good workes which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walke in for the glorifying of his name, and to juſtify unto the world the livelineſſe of our faith, as all the Saints of old have done.</p>
            <p>But now Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> that you may ſee the error of your wayes, and that all men may behold the impiety and vanity of the doctrine of ſelfe-merits, and of the works of ſupererogation, and that we may all be humble under the mighty hand of God, and learne this leſſon of ſelfe-denyall, I ſhall for a corollary, adde a few things, and then conclude this point. Our Saviour Chriſt ſaith <hi>Luke</hi> the 17. <hi>When you ſhall have done all thoſe things that are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſervants: we have done that, which was our duty to doe.</hi> Is not this an extreame arrogancy, think you Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> in any man, when our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, when we have done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is commanded us both in the law and the Goſpell, to ſay, and affirme that we are meriting and deſerving ſervants? yea, is it not an impious ridiculoſity to affirme it, when notwithſtanding we do tranſgreſſe the Commandements of our Maſter a thouſand wayes? For theſe two concluſions do neceſſarily reſult out of our Saviours words. <hi>Firſt, that when wee have done all that God commands, we are yet but unprofitable ſervants. The ſecond, that we have done but that was our duty to doe.</hi> Out of the which words I thus argue.</p>
            <p>Hee, that when he has done all that he is commanded to do, is yet but an unprofitable ſervant, he cannot merit, much leſſe doe workes of ſupererogation: But every man, when he hath done all that is commanded him to doe, is yet but an unprofitable ſervant: <hi>Ergo,</hi> he cannot merit, much leſſe do workes of ſupererogation. All this is confirmed by our Saviours owne words, who cannot erre, we muſt leave the works of merit to Chriſt alone, and ſay we are unprofitable, and deny our ſelves if we will be his Diſciples. Out of the ſame words I gather this argument alſo. They which have done but that which was their duty to do, when they have done all that was commanded them, they cannot merit, much leſſe do workes of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158688:23"/>ſupererogation. But when they have done all that was commanded them both in the Law and Goſpell, they have done but that which was their duty to do. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot merit, much leſſe do works of ſupererogation. You muſt needs underſtand, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> the Doctrine of merits, who are able to diſcourſe a weeke together of them, and therefore you know very well, that in your <hi>Roman</hi> Dialect merits <hi>&amp; works of ſupererogation</hi> are ſuch things and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as are done above that that is commanded them, and when men do more than they are injoyned by God, and exceede in their duty to a ſuperplus. This I ſay is your language. But if no man can attaine to ſuch perfection of obedience as the Romaniſts ſpeake of, then by their own confeſſion the Doctrin of merits is a falſe doctrin and ought by all men to be abominated: and ſo much the rather we ought to abhor it, becauſe it is a Doctrine of blaſphemy, and is as much in effect as to give <hi>the Lord of Life,</hi> truth it ſelfe, the lie: for Chriſt ſayth, <hi>When you have done all things that are commanded you,</hi> ſay, you are unprofitable ſervants, for you have done that which was your duty. Notwithſtanding, the Papiſts ſay they can merit. But Chriſt who is the Maſter and Doctor of his Church, and whom we are commanded to heare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. has taught us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, affirming we cannot merit, much leſſe do workes of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: which will plainly appeare if we examine a few inſtances and go through ſome particulars. We are commanded <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our mind, and with all our migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and to love our Neighbour as our ſelfe.</hi> I now demand of you Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> whether either your ſelfe, or any man can attaine unto this perfection of love, the Lord requires at your hands, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law? If it be acknowledged that no man can attaine to this perfection of love, then he is a tranſgreſſor of the Law, and is ſo far from meriting favour at Gods hand, as he merits eternall death by it: <hi>for the ſoule that ſinnes ſhall die,</hi> Ezekiel 18. <hi>for the wages of ſin is death.</hi> Numb. 6. But if you anſwer, that you can keepe this Law, notwithſtanding you cannot yet merit by it by Chriſts own words, who proclaimeth you an unprofitable ſervant, affirming that you have done but your duty. Againe in the fifth of <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Be yee therefore perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Here the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the ordering of our obedience and regulating of our lives, ſets before us as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, rule and example, which we muſt ever follow, the perfection
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:158688:24"/>that is in God himſelfe our Heavenly father, and commands all men to be <hi>perfect as he himſelfe is perfect.</hi> I demand of you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> can you or any man attaine unto this perfection that is in God, which nevertheleſſe we are commanded to do? If you do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that no man can attaine to it, as no man can indeed, then you are a tranſgreſſor of this command, and fayling in your duty, you deſerve condemnation, and therefore are far from meriting. But if you ſhall affirme that you can attaine to this perfection and ſhould really do that you are commanded: yet you are ſtill an unprofitable ſervant and have done but your duty, and therefore have not yet merited any thing. We are commanded both in the old Teſtament and in the new to be holy, and for the pattern of our holineſſe, as of our perfection, the holineſſe of God is ſet downe before us for our imitation, <hi>As he that hath called you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, is holy, ſo be you holy in all manner of converſation, becauſe it is written, Be yee holy as I am holy, Levit.</hi> 11. ver. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.2. <hi>&amp; the</hi> 20.7. I deſire you to tell me whether you or any man, can attaine to that perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, through the whole courſe of your life, that is in God? if not, you have tranſgreſſed this Commandement, and by it are liable to an eternall puniſhment, having ſinned againſt a moſt holy and eternall Majeſty. But if you ſay you can, you are yet but an unprofitable ſervant and have done but your duty as the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, and have not yet merited. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. verſ. 31.32, 33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>And as you would that men ſhould doe to you, do yee alſo to them likewiſe. For if you love them which love you, what thanks have you? for ſinners alſo love thoſe that love them. And if you do good to them which do good to you, what thanks have you? for ſinners alſo do the ſame. And if yee lend to them, of whom you hope to receive, what thanks have you? for ſinners alſo lend to ſinners, to receive as much againe. But love yee your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing againe: and your reward ſhall be great, and yee ſhall be the children of the Higheſt, for he is kind unto the unthankfull, and to the evill, and be yee alſo mercifull as your Heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi> I demand of you Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> whether ever you or any mortall man ever did fully keepe theſe Precepts and Commandements, and were as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull as God our Heavenly Father is mercifull; if not, you are a tranſgreſſor, and far from merit or works of ſuperrogation; and if you have kept theſe holy Commandements, you are yet but an unprofitable ſervant and have done but your duty. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:158688:24"/>to the <hi>Philippians</hi> chap. 4. verſ. 8. <hi>Finally my brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover things are pure, whatſoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any prayſe, thinke on theſe things. Thoſe things, which yee have both learned and received, and heard, and ſeene in mee, do: and the God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi> What duty Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> in the whole courſe of a mans life, is there, either of love, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards God, or towards our Neighbour that any man can performe, that is not included in this precept, and which by it, he is not bound to do? and the which if he performes not maketh him a tranſgreſſor? and yet if he ſhould perfectly fulfill this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he is but an unprofitable ſervant, and hath done but his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore cannot merit, much leſſe do a worke of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that, the impiety of the doctrine of merits is ſufficiently evinced by that I have now ſaid: I might yet inſtance in a thouſand things, but I wil inſiſt but upon one or two more, which is the leſſon in hand of ſelfe-deniall <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelfe, and take up his croſs dayly and follow me.</hi> I aske you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> whether you thinke your ſelfe or any man, did ever perfectly yet learne this leſſon, and did wholy deny himſelf, and with willingneſſe, and without any murmuring or reſiſting, take up his croſſe and to the laſt houre of his life follow Chriſt both in cheerfull doing and ſuffering, without which his ſervice will not be acceptable: for God loveth only cheerfull ſufferers, as cheerefull givers? If you ſhall anſwer that none can perfectly keepe this precept, you ſhall anſwer truly, and by that acknowledge a tranſgreſſion, which makes you liable to puniſhment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unable to merit by it. But if you ſhall be ſo temerarious as to affirme you can keepe this Commandement, notwithſtanding, you are yet but an unprofitable ſervant in Chriſts eſteeme, and you have done but your duty, becauſe you do no more then God commands you. And truly Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I will grant you thus much, if any thing we can do or performe could merit at Gods hands, ſuffering and dying for his cauſe, and renouncing all honours, pleaſures, and profits and abandoning life it ſelf, for the love of him and his truth, might have the firſt place in our obedience for to challenge merit, yet I ſay, doing all this we are but unprofitable ſervants, and have done but our duty and therefore cannot merit, much leſſe doe a worke of ſupererogation by it, if Chriſts words be true. Yea <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:158688:25"/>in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. verſ. 8. excludes merits even from our ſufferings, ſaying, <hi>I account the afflictions of this preſent time are not worthy the glory that ſhall be ſhewed unto us.</hi> The glory therefore we expect doth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold ſurpaſſe the miſery of our afflictions, therefore our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and ſufferings themſelves are excluded: for if the very martyrs merit not, then ordinary Chriſtians cannot merit. And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. there he ſaith, <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worke for us a farre more exceeding and eternall waight of glory, &amp;c.</hi> Now Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I intreat you to declare unto me how any man by their ſufferings can merit not onely life eternall, but an aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and degree of glory in Heaven, ſeeing by the expreſſe word of the Apoſtle, there is no more proportion betweene that which is moſt excellent, and glorious in this world, and the glory and felicity of the Kingdome of Heaven, than is between a moment of time and eternity: for all men will eaſily conclude, that a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and momentany ſuffering of affliction cannot merit eternall and never ending glory, and that by the light of reaſon, though the Scripture ſhould ſay nothing to the contrary, which doctrine of merit, notwithſtanding, it doth in many places confute. For however the Lord hath made many gracious promiſes in his holy Word, of rewarding his ſuffering ſervants, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 17. ſaying, <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, we may alſo be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified together.</hi> As alſo in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 2. ver. 12. <hi>If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reigne with him.</hi> And innumerable places more might be cited for our incouragement in ſuffering, as that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. ver. 6, 7. <hi>Who will render to every man according to his deeds. To them, who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeeke for glory, and honour, and immortility, eternall life.</hi> All which declare, that God out of his infinite favour will reward his ſervants for the practice of thoſe very gifts and graces he hath beſtowed upon them: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. verſ. 10. <hi>Be thou faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</hi> But ever take notice, this reward, and this Crowne of life is not beſtowed upon ſufferers as wages or reward and merit, but as a gift of mercy and grace, as will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appeare. And if you looke, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> into the 7. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> verſ. 13, 14, 15. there you may, if you ſhut not your eyes, behold the truth of this doctrine, that the very martyrs come not to Heaven for their ſufferings. <hi>And one of the Elders anſwered, and ſaid unto me, What are theſe which are arrayed in white Robes? and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:158688:25"/>whence come they? and he ſaid unto me, Theſe are they which came out of great tribulations, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lambe: therefore they are before the Throne of God, &amp;c.</hi> Here you evidently ſee, that the bleſſed martyrs which are now in Heaven, have not attained unto that felicity and eternall glory by the merit of their ſufferings, but for that they were waſhed in the blood of the Lambe, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And as it is not the ſuffering, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> but the cauſe that makes a martyr; ſo it is not for that they paſſe through many tribulations that they enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, but that they are waſhed in the blood of the Lambe, and by that onely are made worthy to be Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the heavenly Jeruſalem: for when we have ſuffered all, we are but unprofitable ſervants, and have done but our duty, for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If any will be my Diſciple, let him take up his croſſe and follow me.</hi> I will adde but one inſtance more, out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Learne of me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>for I am humble and meeke.</hi> Doe you believe, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that you can keepe, or ever obſerve this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Chriſt the Lord? But if you could attaine unto the greateſt degree of humility and meekneſſe, you were but an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervant, and had done but your duty. But how much more, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> have you and your Roman kindred to anſwer for your loftineſſe and high opinions of your ſelves, who ſtand upon your juſtification by your good workes, and pretend, yea and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of your ſelfe-merits, and of your workes of deſert, and that before God? If this be not a tranſgreſſion, and a very rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commandement, I know not what prevarication and rebellion is. Yea, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if we could obſerve the whole Law, and keepe all the Commandements for doing and ſuffering that ever God gave, if we will be Chriſts Diſciples, we muſt ever ſay we are unprofitable ſervants, and daily pray, <hi>forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> and with the leper cry out, <hi>We are uncleane, we are uncleane,</hi> and have continuall cauſe of deepe humiliation, and ſelfe-deniall. If they, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> which love God moſt, and moſt diligently keepe his Commandements, and yield the greateſt obedience unto them, have need yet of mercy, how can any mortall man then merit before God, who daily and hourely tranſgreſſeth all his glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements? yet ſee what the Lord ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. ver. 6. <hi>Shewing mercy to thouſands, of them that love me and keepe my Commandements.</hi> Learn this leſſon of Chriſt, M. <hi>Montague,</hi> to be humble, and labour for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:158688:26"/>ſelfe-deniall, and a lowly ſpirit, and meeke heart, and with the Church of England, and all the bleſſed Saints, diſavow your owne righteouſneſſe, knowing that Chriſt came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance, &amp; ſuch as are weary and heavy laden, which only finde reſt unto their ſoules; and think not with the Romaniſts, and juſticiaries, by your merits, or good workes to ſcale Heaven, but I intreat you to endeavor with us of the Church of England, <hi>to enter into the moſt holy by the blood of Jeſus, by that new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh, Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. If you enter not by this way, M. <hi>Montague,</hi> you wil never come thither. But now to conclude this point: That Church which doth believe in Jeſus Chriſt, renouncing all ſelfe-merit, and teaches the way to Heaven by the blood of Jeſus, and by that new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way, that Church believes aright, as it ought to believe, and is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile: but the Church of England doth all this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a true Church, where ſalvation may be had. And this note alone is an infallible and never deceiving marke of a true Church. As for antiquity, univerſality, unity, ſucceſſion, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, viſibility, &amp;c. if they have not this doctrine joyned with them, of the free grace of God, and juſtification by faith in Chriſt alone, they are but markes of errour and abomination, which will ſeduce you from the right way, and miſleade you into by-paths where you will never finde reſt for your ſoule. And thus much I thought fit to ſpeake of this point, it being a fundamentall one, and ſuch an one as where it is not preached and publiſhed, there can be no true Church.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the other clauſe of this propoſition, viz. <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all will-worſhip and humane inventions in Gods ſervice.</hi> An eminent marke alſo of a true Church, which when the Church of England doth, it is manifeſt that it is a true Church: For all men know, that mixtures in Gods worſhip annihilates a true Church. But following my former cuſtome, I will firſt ſignifie, what I meane by <hi>will-worſhip and humane inventions in Gods ſervice:</hi> and then ſhew where they are entertained in Gods ſervice and admitted, they ſo adulterate his worſhip, as he himſelfe diſavoweth it, and affirms they ſerve in vaine. By will-worſhip therefore and humane inventions, I underſtand, whatſoever, either for <hi>Doctrine, Service, Diſcipline, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> men out of vaine devotion, doting or ſuperfluous feare, or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:158688:26"/>unbridled errour, or out of humane reaſon or hypocriſie, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other pretence they have out of their own brain excogitated and brought into the ſervice &amp; worſhip of God, or whatſoever they have added to his worſhip, either of images or repreſentations, or traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt his revealed will, or without his expreſſe command, and impoſed upon the people as the worſhip and ſervice of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime theſe their ordinances to be Gods ſervice and worſhip, and place holineſſe and religion in the obſervation of them, and account the neglect of them irreligion and prophaneneſſe, and worthy of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and the ſubmiſſion to them piety, religion, and obedience, which God notwithſtanding proclaimes an abomination to him. For piety and true religion proceeds from the right knowledge of God, the firſt of the which is the reverence of God, joyn'd with love, which ariſeth from the knowledge and contemplation of Gods manifold favours, mercy and goodneſſe towards mankind; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond which is pure and true religion, is faith joyned with a ſerious and earneſt feare of God, the which feare containes in it a voluntary and willing reverence, and alwaies brings with it, the right and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act forme of worſhiping him, which is onely that way of ſerving him which he hath preſcribed in his holy Word, which Word of God alone muſt be the rule of his worſhip, and of all our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo that what he preſcribeth and enjoyneth, it is our duty both to know and performe, and the neglect of which is ſinne: and whatſoever is contrary to this is either open idolatry, or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe it is <hi>ſupra quod ſtatutum eſt;</hi> and therefore hatefull to God, and abominable in his ſight, as his whole Word declares. And as it is the glory, honour, and very note of a true Church, to follow the rule of Gods Word in ſerving him: ſo it is the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marke of a falſe Church, where either open idolatry, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſuperſtition, or mens traditions and devices domineere, and are ſet up and countenanced for Gods ſervice, by what authority ſoever it be: all which I underſtand by will-worſhip, and humane inventions in Gods ſervice, ſo that, that Church is reputed the true Church that ſerves God according to his will revealed in his Word, and continues in its native purity and primitive ſimplicity, and whoſe eares are not hanged with the Jewels of Jewiſh, Paganiſh, or Popiſh ceremonies, and humane inventions, for true religion doth not conſiſt in the obſervation of the traditions of men, and their pompous ceremonies, but in the obeying of Gods Commandements,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:158688:27"/>that is, in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy of the holy Ghoſt, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all from a pure heart and conſcience purged from dead works, and faith unfeigned. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my meaning of will-worſhip and humane inventions in Gods ſervice, all which are againſt his expreſſe word, and adulterate his worſhip, and annihilate a Church, which things I will prove in order. <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord, as we read in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. verſ. 40. had an expreſſe command when he was to make the Tabernacle, that he ſhould doe all <hi>according to the patterne he had ſeen in the mount.</hi> So that if <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>ſaw God face to face</hi> might not adde or put ſo much as a Law to the Tabernacle that God had not commanded him, what boldneſſe and impudence then is it in any man, to dare to introduce any thing in Religion, either for Doctrine, Service, Diſcipline or Ceremony, that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles have taught or commanded, eſpecially when God in his holy Word hath commanded the contrary? For in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. ver 2. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall not adde to the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh from it, that you may keepe the commandements of God which I command you.</hi> Now if the Church of the Jewes ought not to joyne or adde any thing to that which God commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> how much leſſe ought the Chriſtian Church to adde any thing to that which Chriſt and his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts have taught in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, when they have ſo fully declared the will of God therein? and in the fiſt chapter of the ſame booke, verſe 32. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve to doe therefore, as the Lord your God hath commanded you: ye ſhall not turne aſide to the right hand or to the left.</hi> Here obſerve, that God forbids not onely <hi>to turn unto the left hand,</hi> which is to ſay, to doctrines manifeſtly wicked and abominable: but he forbids them alſo <hi>to turne to the right hand,</hi> which is of purpoſe ſpoke, to prevent all mens inventions, under what pretence or appearance ſoever of devotion or religion, as of more cleanly, neatly, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſerving God. And in the 12. chapter, verſ. 32. as if the Lord could never ſufficiently enough have inculcated this precept upon them, he ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever I command you obſerve to doe it, thou ſhalt not adde thereto, nor diminiſh from it.</hi> How then dare any either receive or admit the traditions and ordinances of men, and joyn them with the Commandements of God, when notwithſtanding God enjoynes us onely to obſerve and doe what he commands, without adding thereto or detracting from it. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. ver. 21. <hi>My ſonne,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:158688:27"/>
               <hi>Solomon, feare thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change; for their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> In theſe words, there is a command, and in it a direction to all Iſrael, teaching them what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould not doe in Gods matters, a precept both imperative and prohibitive, and every word of it deſerving due conſideration and ſerious thoughts. For howſoever this command was peculiarly given to the Iſraelites, and eſpecially concerned that government; yet in the generall equity of obedience it concernes all Chriſtians, and bridleth them likewiſe from making any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or innovation in Gods ordinances, and in his government, eſtabliſhed in his Church, and prohibits all Chriſtians, to meddle with, or have any communion with ſuch as are given to change. The principall obſervables in theſe words, not accurately to handle them, are briefly theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, a duty enjoyned, <hi>feare;</hi> and that twofold: towards God, and towards the King; and in the word <hi>feare</hi> ſynecdochically we are to underſtand all reverence towards God, and indeed his whole worſhip, which is to give him his due honour, as in the ſame word is included all civill obedience and honour to thoſe that are ſet over us in authority, and that ſpecified in expreſſe tearmes, <hi>Feare God and the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond obſervable, implicitly ſet downe, is the rule by which they ſhould regulate their feare and obedience, both towards God and the King, and that was the whole Law, both morall, judiciall, and ceremoniall, and all that ſetled government, as it was then by God himſelfe eſtabliſhed in the daies of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> by Gods owne commandment, according unto the pattern the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>David</hi> in writing, and <hi>David</hi> to his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi> both for the place, and manner of Gods worſhip, and the ordering of the Kingdome, which was to be perpetuated and continued without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or innovation, till the comming of the Meſſiah, without a ſpeciall command and warrant from God himſelfe: and this Law and Word of God is that rule implicitly here ſet down, from which they were not to vary or make any change, but to obſerve that in ordering their feare and obedience both to God and the King. For that feare and reverence only is pleaſing unto God, that is according to his owne command, not that which we out of our owne braine imagine, or what men conceive: for the Lord abhors all ſuch feare
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:158688:28"/>as is taught by the precepts of men, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29. ver. 13. ſaying, <hi>The feare towards me, is taught by the Precepts of men.</hi> And in the 15. of <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. our Saviour ſaith of ſuch feare, <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip me, teaching for doctrine the commandements of men.</hi> So that all that feare, reverence, and obedience that we deſire or endeavour to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God by, if it have not a warrant our of his word, it is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto him being will-worſhip. And as our feare towards God, muſt be warranted by his word, ſo all our obedience to civill autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, muſt be in the Lord: for Magiſtrates and Governours in Iſrael, and all Chriſtian Governours at this day, are commanded to rule, and order their Kingdomes, according to Gods Word, as we may ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. verſ. 18, 19, 20. and <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. And thoſe Kings and Princes that rule not by Gods Word, uſe not nor manage not a Kingdome, but a robbery, when they reigne not to this end, that God may be glorified, and his name honoured in their dominions. Neither may they thinke them ſelves exempted for their greatneſſe: for St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. ver. 19. <hi>Now we know, that whatſoever things the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world become ſubject to the judgment of God.</hi> So that all Magiſtrates as well as ſubjects, that are under the law, whether morall or Evangelicall, they are all to be ſubject to the Law of God, without exception, and to be guided by it, and to rule and command according to that rule, and they have their bounds ſet them, how farre they may goe in commanding, and that is according to the Will of God, and no farther. And the ſubjects likewiſe, have their limits preſcribed unto them, how farre they may obey, and that is in the Lord, and no farther. And ſo long as the Magiſtrates keepe themſelves within the compaſſe of Gods Commandements, and command according to his Word and Will, the ſubjects in conſcience are bound to obey. But if rulers will tranſgreſſe and goe beyond their confines, the ſubjects have a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from their obedience, <hi>Knowing that they ought to obey God, rather than men, Acts</hi> 5. ver. 29. Yea, Chriſt himſelfe hath taught us this leſſon, <hi>Marke</hi> 8. ver. 15. <hi>Saying, take heed and beware of the leaven of the Phariſes, and of the leaven of Herod.</hi> Here is a doubling, as it were of the caution, <hi>Take heed and beware.</hi> Of what? of all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and traditions of all ſorts of men, whether Eccleſiaſticall or Civill in Gods ſervice; for by leven our Saviour underſtands the traditions and doctrines of the Phariſees and Sadduces, as is evident
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:158688:28"/>in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. v. 12. &amp; many other places; ſo that under what authority ſoever they come ratified, be it from Kings and Princes themſelves, as here by <hi>Herod,</hi> we have a diſpenſation from our obedience. And there are many prendents in Gods Word of ſuch as have detracted their obedience to unlawfull commands with Gods good liking, as the Midwives in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. the three children in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> in <hi>Eſter,</hi> and the Apoſtles <hi>Act.</hi> 5. to omit many other. And in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words in the 13. of <hi>Deut.</hi> God abſolves very children from their duty of obedience to their parents, which he ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the 20. of <hi>Exod.</hi> if they command againſt Gods Word. So that the common rule for all both in commanding and obeying, is Gods Word, according to which our feare and obedience towards all muſt be regulated, as is here manifeſt. And this rule did <hi>Solomon</hi> tie and binde all Iſrael to, and all Chriſtians to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>The third obſervable, is a caveat or dehortation, to decline the ſociety and company of ſuch as would bring in any alteration or innovation either in religion, or the government then eſtabliſhed, in theſe words, <hi>And meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> In which caution, two things are denoted, the one in expreſſe termes, the other tacitely; that which is expreſſed, is, that we ſhould have no communion or familiarity with ſuch as are innovators, or goe about, or endeavour either to change the worſhip of God, or to alter any thing in matters of religion. That which is tacitly ſet downe, is, that every man, in his owne perſon, ſhould have a ſpeciall care, that he himſelfe make no change in religion, or bring in any alteration in the government of the Church, which Chriſt the Lord hath in his holy Word eſtabliſhed and ordained, knowing that it is to be perpetuated and continued as was leſt by Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles to the end of the world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. verſ. 21. &amp; chap. 6. ver. 13, 14. <hi>I charge thee,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things, and before Jeſus Chriſt, which under Pontius Pilate witneſſed a good confeſſion: that thou keep this commandement without ſpot, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, untill the appearing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefore, that was eſtabliſhed and ſetled by the Apoſtles, is without any alteration by all Chriſtians to be preſerved as much as in them lies, they muſt make no change in it; and this charge is given to every ſoule in particular tacitly (as I ſaid): for if we muſt not keepe company or meddle with ſuch as are given to change,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:158688:29"/>then wee our ſelves may make no alteration or change.</p>
            <p>The fourth obſervable is the reaſon of this dehortation, why they ſhould not meddle with ſuch as are given to change, and that is in regard of the danger and miſery that will enſue upon it: <hi>For their calamity,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ſhall riſe ſuddainly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> here is ruine threatned, and that both ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and inevitable. A forcible reaſon therefore to dehort any man from keeping company with wicked and ungodly men, and ſuch eſpecially as innovate or change any thing in religion: for by ſo doing they make themſelves lyable to the ſame puniſhment, and are equally guilty, according to that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 50. ver. 18. <hi>When thou ſaweſt a thiefe, thou conſentedſt with him, &amp;c.</hi> So that the very conſenting to evill, brings a guilt, and with it a puniſhment as well as the acting of it, and this truth by the very light of nature was taught by the heathen, and profeſt through the world, who make complices and conſenters to any treaſon or conſpiracy, as guilty as the contrivers and actors; and the holy Word of God is full of preſidents of this nature. It is ſaid of <hi>Jezabell</hi> that ſhe kild the Prophets. But when <hi>Elias</hi> puts up his bill of information into the Court of Heaven, he ſpeaks there in the number of multitude, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord they have killed thy Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. verſ. 14. Here the Officers and the people, as well as <hi>Jezabell,</hi> are guilty and lyable to puniſhment, and that becauſe they did helpe her and aſſent unto all her wickedneſſe. So <hi>Paul</hi> in his information againſt all the Gentiles, in the firſt chapter and laſt verſe, he makes them all equally guilty, as if they had been all actors of thoſe villanies, and liable to the <hi>wrath of God, which was revealed from Heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe, and ungodlineſſe,</hi> ver. 18. as well for conſenting unto them in their wicked waies, as acting; his words are theſe, <hi>Who knowing the judgement of God (that they that do ſuch things are worthy of death) not onely doe the ſame, but conſent with them that doe them, or have pleaſure in them that do them.</hi> Conſenters and actors in Gods account are equally guilty. <hi>Herod</hi> is ſaid to have killed <hi>John Baptiſt:</hi> but when our Saviour Chriſt upon an occaſion ſpeakes of St. <hi>John Baptiſt, They,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have done to him whatſoever they pleaſed.</hi> Here our Saviour makes all the people guilty, the Nobles that ſate at Table with <hi>Herod,</hi> and did not diſſwade him from that tyranny, nor ſpeake in the behalfe of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> the Officers that forwarded and furthered the bloody deſigne, and all the people that aſſented unto <hi>Herods</hi> wickedneſſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:158688:29"/>and crueltie. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the death of the bleſſed martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> makes himſelfe as equally guilty of perſecution, and of his death, as if he had been an actor and had flung ſtones at him with the reſt, ſaying, <hi>When thy holy martyr Stephen was ſlaine, I ſtood by, and aſſented unto it.</hi> And in <hi>Jeremy</hi> 5. ver. 30, 31. <hi>A wonderfull and horrible thing,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is committed in the Land. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets propheſie faſly, and the Prieſts beare rule by their meanes, and my people love to have it ſo, &amp;c.</hi> Here the people aſſenting and allowing of theſe evils, made themſelves equally guilty, and liable to the ſame puniſhment. And therefore it is a very dangerous thing to have any familiarity with notorious wicked men, or to meddle with ſuch eſpecially as are given to change, and therefore by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> expreſly forbidden, and that in regard of the danger that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth upon it, which is <hi>ſudden calamity and ruine</hi> to them both, to both actors, and abettors, or conſenters. And all this ruine and calamity came both upon <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that made a change in Religion, and in that government, againſt this command, and all that joyned with him, and aſſented to him, as the ſtory of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> doe ſufficiently declare; and by that teach us to take heed we make no change or alteration in religion and Gods matters, leſt we partake of the ſame plague, knowing that all thoſe things were written for our example, upon whom the ends of the world are come. And therefore, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that Church that renounceth all will-worſhip, &amp; humane inventions in Gods ſervice, in ſo doing manifeſts her obedience to the Commandements of God, and heares his voyce, by which ſhe declares herſelfe to be a true Church, and founded upon the foundation of <hi>Peter:</hi> all which the Church of England doth, and is by Gods grace reſolved to doe, and never to admit of any humane inventions in Gods worſhip and ſervice, being ſo often taught to the contrary, both by precept and by example. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 18. in condemning and rejecting the worſhip and adoration of Angels, and all will-worſhip, contents himſelfe, and thinks it ſufficient to ſay, that it was a humane invention: to teach all Chriſtians for ever, to baniſh out of their religion, whatſoever men deviſe or invent of their owne braines, and innovate in Gods worſhip, under what pretence of humility and devotion ſoever it be. His words are theſe, <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:158688:30"/>ſeene, vainly puft of by his fleſh,</hi> and in the 20. <hi>verſe, Wherefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if yee be dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the World, why as though living in the World, are yee ſubject to Ordinances, after the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Doctrine of men?</hi> Here he rejects and renounces all will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip and ſerving of God by humane traditions, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the danger of it, becauſe it ſeparated them from their Head Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. but becauſe it was an humane invention, and blames the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> for ſuffering and ſubjecting themſelves to them. And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> chap. the 1. v. 13.14. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>rebuke them ſharply, that they may be ſound in the faith, Not giving heede to Jewiſh fables, and commandements of men which turne from the truth.</hi> Here is a generall prohibition to all Chriſtians, not to give heed to the Commandements and traditions of men in Religion, with a Reaſon of the ſame annexed to the prohibition, for, ſuch Commandements, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>turne men from the truth,</hi> and lead them into by-wayes, and corrupt, and adulterate Religion, and overthrow the Church which ſhould be the ground and pillar of truth, and ſo rob it of happineſſe and of injoying the Head, which is Chriſt Jeſus. And the truth of this Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is confirmed by innumerable preſidents in all ages; for humane inventions corrupt Gods ſervice. As yee may ſee in 32 of <hi>Exodus;</hi> when they ſet up the Calfe, and built an Altar before it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a feaſt unto it, and were very merry and highly pleaſed themſelves in their own inventions. But heare what the Lord ſaith to <hi>Moſes, verſ.</hi> the 7. <hi>Go, get thee downe: for thy people which thou broughteſt out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>have corrupted themſelves, they have turned aſide quickly out of the way, &amp;c.</hi> Here innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion and humane inventions corrupted the people, and turned them aſide quickly out of the way to Heaven. The ſame is evident in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who cauſed all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne, and the ten Tribes to fall from God, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in his changing of Religion, contrary unto the precept of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the place above ſpecified: for ſetting up his Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> (as it is to be ſeene at large in the firſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> the 12.) and ordaining a feaſt unto them, and ſetting up an Altar and ſacrificing on it, and changing both the time and place of Gods Worſhip, and making Prieſts of the meane people, which were not of the ſonnes of <hi>Laevi,</hi> and cauſing the people to goe up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; This, ſayes the Lord, <hi>became a ſinne unto them,</hi> ſo that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:158688:30"/>the Lord in many places ſayes they ſacrificed unto Divells: and therfore by theſe their inventions and by this their will-worſhip they ſo provoked the Lord as they brought ſuddaine calamity, and ruin upon themſelves, which the Lord by <hi>Solomon</hi> had foretold them, and the Lord caſt them off and gave them into captivity, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them over to their enemies hand, and gave them a bill of divorce, to teach all people to feare and tremble how by their owne inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and will-worſhip, they provoke the Lord leſt he caſt them off as he did the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Here we may bring in alſo the Tribe of <hi>Iuda</hi> and all <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who by their inventions and imitating of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and other idolatrous Nations corrupted all their wayes, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated their Religion, and provoked the Lord to wrath, who gave them likewiſe, for their idolatry and will-worſhip and their other abominations, that ever follow the profaning of Religion, into captivity, and expoſed the whole Kingdomes to deſolation. But the example of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> is not to be paſſed by, who boaſted much of antiquity and their Father <hi>Iacob,</hi> though there was but little kindred between them and leſſe affienity in the true Religion; yet there are many things ſpoke of them worthy to be taken notice of, for it is ſaid in the ſecond of the <hi>Kings</hi> the 17. that they were taught how they ſhould feare the Lord, and they feared the Lord, &amp;c. and they obſerved <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rites, Ceremonies and Diſcipline, and they looked for the Meſſiah to come, as wee ſee in <hi>Iohn</hi> the 4. and they had great agreement and harmony in many Articles and points of Religion with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the only then true worſhipers of God, ſo that to the outward appearance they differed but little, yet by their own inventions, ſuperſtitions, idolatry and traditions they had ſo corrupted the whole worſhip of God, that the Scripture denyes that they feared the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. becauſe they did after their former manners, and did not according <hi>to the Statutes and Ordinances and after the Law and Commandements, which the Lord commanded to the children of</hi> Jacob, <hi>whom he named Iſrael,</hi> and therefore our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt pronounces them void of ſalvation, affirming <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped they knew not what,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> knowing what they did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that ſalvation was of the <hi>Iewes, Ioh.</hi> 4. So that the truth of what I aſſerted is manifeſt, that humane inventions in Gods ſervice and wil-worſhip adulterates a true Church and overthrowes Religion, for God will indure no mixtures. Now Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> if one ſhould in every particular compare the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with either the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:158688:31"/>of <hi>Jſrael</hi> in all their idolatries, or with the Church of <hi>Samaria</hi> in all her ſuperſtitious and fained inventions, and fee what ruin and calamity came upon them by it, and how by their idolatries they deprived themſelves of Gods favour and of ſalvation, we ſhall finde that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth as far exceede either of them in idolatry, ſuperſtition and all manner of profaneneſſe and wil-worſhip as a giant in greatneſſe doth a pygme, and therefore Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not repent and renounce all her will-worſhip and her humane inventions as the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath done, ſhee will partake of the ſame plagues that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> did in this world, and finally be deprived of life eternall; and all thoſe that do partake with her in her ſinnes, muſt partake with her in her plagues: therefore Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> follow Chriſts counſell, come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> leſt you partake with her in her puniſhment, if you will continue in her ſinnes. Imitate in this the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who obeying the voyce of Chriſt her head and husband, and comming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and flying all Idolatry and will-worſhip, proves her ſelfe to be a true Church and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and to be the pillar of truth, and where ſalvation may be had. And this might ſuffice to have ſpoke of wil-worſhip; but in way of a corollary, and for direction to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans what order to take, or what meanes to uſe for the triall of all Doctrines, Diſciplines, Service or Ceremonies, I ſhall adde a word or two more and ſo conclude this point. Our Saviour in the 11 of <hi>Mat. verſ.</hi> 30. gives unto men a Rule of direction, which if they follow, it will preſerve them from all error, and keepe them in the right way of ſerving of God. <hi>The Baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>was it from Heaven, or of men?</hi> Anſwer <hi>mee,</hi> ſaith he, inferring, if it were of men, that then it ought not to be entertained in Gods worſhip, and that the <hi>Jewes</hi> knew very well. In the ſame manner, ought all Chriſtians to examine and try every doctrine, either of ſervice, ceremony or diſcipline, whether it be of God, or of men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Rule of Chriſt, and that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt of the <hi>Theſſ.</hi> chap. the 5. v. the 21. <hi>Try all things, and keepe that which is good:</hi> Now then Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if we examine whoſe image and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription every Ordinance beares and carries with it, whether <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> or Gods, that is, whether it be preſcribed by human or Divine authority, all the controverſy then would ſpeedily be ended, for if it be of God and warranted by his Word, then all ready obedience
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:158688:31"/>is to be yeilded unto it without reluctation, when under that notion, it is preſcribed and ordered by the Magiſtrate. But if it be a meere humane invention, and hath no warrant from God our Father, we ought to reject it. So ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 7. v. 24. <hi>Brethren, yee are bought with a price: be not ſervants of men.</hi> And in the firſt Chap. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 8.9. <hi>But though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach unto you otherwiſe, than that we have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, let him be accurſed. As I ſaid before, ſo I ſay now againe, if any man Preach unto you otherwiſe, than that yee have received, let him be accurſed:</hi> Here the Apoſtle doubles the curſe upon all ſuch as ſhall teach otherwiſe, for Doctrine, Service, Diſcipline, or Ceremonies, than they were taught by him and the other Diſciples. And by his owne example in the verſe following he teacheth us plainly, that if we goe about to pleaſe men in receiving their Doctrines, we cannot be the ſervants of God: for we cannot ſerve two maſters: his words are theſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. For do I now perſwade or <hi>preach mans</hi> doctrine, <hi>or Gods? or do I ſeeke to pleaſe men? for if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt:</hi> all therefore, that intertaine and admit of humane inventions in Gods ſervice and worſhip, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the Apoſtle, the ſervants of men, and not of God. A buſineſſe of great concernment and worthy of due conſideration. And truly Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if a man ſhould run through all the new Doctrines for Service, Diſcipline and Ceremonies in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and inquire whether they were from Heaven or of men, we ſhall not in all Gods Word find any warrant for them; for they are all the inventions of crafty men, who imployed their wiſdome and abilities of underſtanding to amuſe the people with theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performances, and kept them from the glorious light of the Goſpell, that by this meanes, having put out that ſhining and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Candle of Truth, they might better vent their Romiſh ware in the darke, and lead the people into errors and by-wayes to the diſtraction and ruin of their poore ſoules: for, impoſing upon them, all their traditions and will-worſhip as the ſervice of God, and puniſhing the leaſt neglect of their Ordinances with greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, than the breach of all Gods Commandements, it is manifeſt to all men, that they are not onely the ſervants of men, but lyable to the curſe the Apoſtle here pronounces againſt all thoſe that teach otherwiſe, than they have received from him: and make the poore people alſo ſubject to the ſame condemnation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:158688:32"/>the Church of <hi>England</hi> in conſideration of the great danger ſhee was in by reaſon of the prodigious idolatry and will-worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath timely renounced all theſe inventions of men, and ſerves God now in ſpirit and truth, as all thoſe that worſhip aright do, <hi>John</hi> 4. and cleaves only to Jeſus Chriſt, and his teaching, diſavowing all humane inventions in Gods ſervice, and therefore is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believes as it ought to believe. And thus much I thought fit to ſpeak, concerning Will-worſhip.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to the third part of my propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>continueth ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi> An infallible marke of a true Church. By ſtedfaſtly continuing, I underſtand ſuch an adhering and cleaving to the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as they finde it in the written word of the old and new Teſtament, as they make that, and that only the Rule of their faith and obedience, and no unwritten word, or Traditions, Councells or Fathers, no farther than they are grounded upon the written word contained in the holy Bible. And this the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath good warrant to do from Chriſts both precept and example, and from both the Prophets and Apoſtles practice. <hi>John</hi> the 5. v. the 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for in them yee thinke to have eternall life, and they are they which teſtify of mee.</hi> And v. 46.47. <hi>for, had yee believed</hi> Moſes, <hi>you would have believed me; for he wrote of me; but if yee believe not his writings, how ſhall you believe my words?</hi> Here our Saviour Chriſt ratifyes <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings to be of Divine authority, and equalizes them with, if not prefers them before his owne words, ſaying, <hi>if yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not his writings, how ſhall yee believe my words?</hi> And in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Luke</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Chriſt ſendeth all men that deſire ſalvation, to the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, v. 29, 30, 31. <hi>they have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets: let them heare them,</hi> if they would eſcape damnation, <hi>and have eternall life.</hi> And <hi>Dives</hi> ſayd, <hi>Nay Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Abraham, <hi>but if one come unto them from the dead, they will amend their lives, and repent. And he ſaid unto him, If they heare not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi> Here our Saviour tyes them preciſely to the Scriptures, and affirmes they are more prevalent to bring men unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and to ſave their ſoules, than any miracles whatſoever, and therefore that they are only to be cleaved unto by all the ſonnes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:158688:32"/>of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And as he commanded all men to have recourſe to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſo all the time of his life, and after his reſurrection hee taught all his auditors out of the holy Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> the 24. verſ. 27. and after that our Saviour Chriſt had upbrayded his Diſciples for their unbeliefe, <hi>He began,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>at Moſes, and all the Prophets, and expounded to them through all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelfe.</hi> And verſ. 44. <hi>he ſaid unto them, Theſe are the words which I ſpake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things muſt be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes concerning me.</hi> Here our Saviour Chriſt inſtructs and teaches his Diſciples onely out of the written Word, and in them all Chriſtians, and ſends them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and affirmes that they were the voice of God, which the Lord ſpake and uttered by them. All the Prophets likewiſe ſent the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the written word, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. &amp; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8. ver. 20. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimonies,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> Here the Lord by his Prophet ſends all men to the written Word, in which he declared his pleaſure and will unto them, and affirmes that they that ſpeake not according to that Word, they have no light in them, that is, they are in errour and darkneſſe; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, Matth.</hi> 22. ever ſending them to the Scripture for knowledge. And <hi>Malac.</hi> 4. the Lord there, verſ. 4. <hi>Remember, ſaith he, the law of Moſes my ſervant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb, for all Iſrael, with the ſtatutes and judgements.</hi> Here all the Church of the Jewes were ſent unto the written Word, and manded ever to remember that that was left by Gods appointment for the rule of their faith and obedience, and to that onely they were ſtedfaſtly to cleave. And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. verſ. 14. in his owne defence before <hi>Felix</hi> ſpeakes thus, <hi>This I confeſſe unto thee, that after the way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my fathers, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> The written word was the ground of his faith, he continued ſtedfaſtly in the doctrine of the Prophets, and taught all men ſo to doe, proving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his doctrine out of the holy Sciptures of the Prophets, and convincing <hi>the Jewes out of them from morning to evening, Acts</hi> 28. ver. 23. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. ver. 22. <hi>Witneſſing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>both to ſmall and great, ſaying no other things than thoſe which the Prophets
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:158688:33"/>and Moſes did ſay ſhould come.</hi> Nothing but Scripture, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in them, was the foundation of both the true Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and Chriſtian Church. And <hi>Apollos</hi> a man eloquent and mighty in the Scripture, uſed the ſame way of teaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. verſ. 28. who ſhewed by the Scriptures <hi>that Jeſus was that Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle, chap. 5. verſ. 19, 20. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>deſpiſe not the Propheſies:</hi> a thing worthy the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; after he had exhorted them to nouriſh in themſelves the ſparks of the Spirit of God kindled in them, that they might not be deluded by any falſe ſpirit, or conceive they had the Spirit, when they had it not, he ties them to the rule by which they ſhould try the Spirits, whether they be of God or not; and that rule was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the old Teſtament, and the ſtudying of them. As much as if he had ſaid to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> nouriſh daily within you all the graces of knowledge and wiſdome, the Spirit of God hath beſtowed upon you, and increaſe more and more in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus, ſaying, <hi>Quench not the Spirit;</hi> and that you may the better increaſe in knowledge and abound in all gifts and graces, and the truth, and that ye may not be led away with any deceiving ſpirit, and vaine deluſion, inſtead of true illumination, after the manner of many enthuſiaſts, who dreame of new inſpirations, new lights, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate your whole illumination and your ſpirit and knowledge according unto the written propheſies of the old Teſtament, follow them and you cannot erre, <hi>therefore, ſaith he, deſpiſe not the propheſies,</hi> but by them <hi>try all things,</hi> and keepe that which is good and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them, and whatſoever is not agreeable to them is a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and not the true Spirit, who is ever like it ſelfe, and therefore he ties them to the propheſies of the old Teſtament, as well as to the Scriptures of the new. So Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 1. verſ. 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure word of the Prophets,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the which ye doe well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, untill the day dawne, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in our hearts.</hi> Here the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ties all Chriſtians as well to the written Word of the old as to the Scriptures of the new. This written Word was the foundation of the Church of the Jewes, and is of all Chriſtians. It was the praiſe of all the Chriſtians of the Primitive Church, that <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and breaking of bread, and prayer, Acts</hi> 2. ver. 42. and that they ſearched the Scriptures, as the <hi>Bereans.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:158688:33"/>the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 19, 20. <hi>for their comfort tels them, that they were not ſtrangers and forainers, but Citizens with the Saints and of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſhold of God;</hi> and confirmes it unto them with a ſtrong reaſon that they were the people of God, and a true Church, becauſe ſaith he, <hi>Ye are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner Stone.</hi> So that to continue conſtantly in the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, is an irreſiſtible argument and proofe of a true Church, and that it is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> Which when the Church of England continueth in, ſwarving in nothing from that rule, but alwaies hearing the voice of Chriſt, it is manifeſt they are his ſheep, and are of God, for ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8. ver. 7. <hi>He that is of God heareth Gods Words, ye therefore heare them not, becauſe ye are not of God,</hi> ſpeaking there to the unbelieving Jewes. And chap. 10. <hi>My ſheepe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he are my voice,</hi> ver. 27. And in Chap. 18. ver. 17. <hi>Every one,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that is of the truth heareth my voice.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 4. ver. 6. ſaith, <hi>We are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us: he that is not of God heareth us not. Hereby know we the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of error.</hi> In theſe words St. <hi>John</hi> confirmeth that his own doctrine, and the doctrine of all the Apoſtles was the aſſured Word of God, and that they that were of God did heare it; and that they that did not heare it, that is, obey it, were not of God; and that by this doctrine alone all men might diſtinguiſh truth from errour, they that heare this doctrine are of the truth, they that heare it not are led by the ſpirit of errour, and are in darkneſſe. Now then, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> when the Church of England in all things heareth the voyce of Chriſt, and cleaveth onely to the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, &amp; the Church of Rome is not grounded upon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, but upon their vain traditions, doctrines of men, and will not ſuffer the Word of God to be read amongſt the people, nor permit the voice of Chriſt to be heard amongſt them, this neceſſarily followes from thence: that the Church of England is a true Church, and built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Church of Rome is a falſe Church, and founded upon errour and deluſion. And therefore, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if you deſire ſalvation, come out of that confuſed Babylon, into the boſome of the Church of England, that teacheth the way, the truth, and the life, and you will finde reſt unto your ſoule. And this ſhall ſatisfie to have ſpoken of this third part of my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:158688:34"/>
            <p> Now I come to the fourth part, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the Goſpell is purely preached, repentance towards God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, and in which there is the true invocation of God. Another infallible and never deceiving note of a true Church, which were it ſingle and alone, were ſufficient to evince to the whole world, that the Church of England is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter:</hi> and therefore believes as it ought to believe. By the pure preaching of the Goſpell, and right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments, and the true invocation of God, I underſtand, when all things are done in the miniſtry and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the name of God and prayer, according to Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and according to the commiſſion delivered unto the Apoſtles, without addition of any thing, or diminution, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all things according unto the rule preſcribed in all punctuall manner by ſuch as God hath fitted for wiſdome, learning, and all divine knowledge for that holy imployment, and who doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in all uprightneſſe, ſincerity, and godly ſimplicity, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. verſ. 17. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not as many, which make merchandiſe of the Word of God: but of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeake we in Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtles did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the miniſtry craftily, or coveteouſly, or leſſe ſincerely than they ought, as more fully is expreſſed in chap. 4. ver. 2. where he ſaith, <hi>We have caſt from us the cloake of ſhame, and walke not in crafri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither handle we the Word of God deceitfully: but in declaration of the truth, we approve our ſelves to every mans conſcience, in the ſight of God.</hi> The Apoſtles preached the Goſpell without ſubtilty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, ſeeking no lurking-holes to cover their ſhameleſſe dealing, they preached not <hi>with excellency of words</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares) <hi>or of wiſdome in ſhewing the teſtimony of God,</hi> which was the Goſpell; neither was their <hi>word and preaching in the inticing ſpeach of mans wiſdome, but in plaine evidence of the Spirit, and of power,</hi> and not for ſelf-ends. After this example of the bleſſed Apoſtle is the Goſpell preached by the Miniſters of the Church of England, who diſpenſe the Ordinances according to their Commiſſion, neither adding nor detracting from it in any thing, but withall care, ſedulity, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, without baſe ends, and ſelf-reſpects, attend upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in their particular places, and as they are made Watchmen unto
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:158688:34"/>their flockes by God himſelfe, ſo they receive the word from his mouth, and give warning to the people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. ver. 17. and they ſwerve not from the rule: which will the better appeare, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Commiſſion the Lord Jeſus gave to the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ver. 19. <hi>Goe therefore,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt. Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, untill the end of the world.</hi> Their commiſſion was limited, that they ſhould ſpeake nothing but what Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, nothing of their owne heads and braines, and keeping themſelves within their limits they were ever ſure of Gods preſence and aſſiſtance who had promiſed them and all their ſucceſſours in ſo doing, to be with them to the end of the world: they were bound therefore to teach nothing but Gods commands, and that the holy Apoſtles obſerved, and commanded all men, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach otherwiſe than they had taught them, not to heare them, under a fearefull curſe, <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. Now when the Church of England diligently keepes it ſelfe to the Commiſſion given by Chriſt unto his Apoſtles, and preaches the Goſpell in all purity, without any mixture of their owne inventions and doctrines, and that with all ſimplicity and godly integrity, and adminiſters the holy Sacraments without any addition, diminution or detraction, according as Chriſt appointed, and cals upon the name of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath taught, it is cleare to all men that the Church of England is a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> All which will more perſpicuouſly be evidenced if we examine the ſeverall commiſſions of the Apoſtles, and conſider what they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto the people, whoſe example for preaching and doctrine the Church of England in all things follows, and ſwarves not from. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. ver. 37. <hi>When the people were pricked in their hearts at his Sermon, and ſaid unto the Apoſtles, Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> in Verſe 38. according to his commiſſion, <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt: for the promiſe is to you and your children, and to all that are afarre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> To preach faith and repentance unto the people was their commiſſion. And in chap. 3. ver. 23. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſinnes may be blotted out, &amp;c.</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets downe his commiſſion in the places following,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:158688:35"/>in Chap. 13. ver. 23. <hi>Be it knowne unto you therefore men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you forgiveneſſe of ſinnes. And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes his commiſſion to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and what by that he was to doe in Gods ſervice and imployments. His words are theſe, <hi>I have,</hi> ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter and a witneſſe, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things I will appeare unto thee, in delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee. To open their eyes, and to turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</hi> Here is the Apoſtles Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Now let us take notice how he executes it. <hi>Whereupon, O King Agrippa,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I was not diſobedient unto the heavenly viſion, but ſhewed firſt unto them of Damaſcus and at Jeruſalem, and through all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance.</hi> So that in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his commiſſion in opening their eyes, and turning men from darkneſſe unto light, and from <hi>the power of Satan unto God,</hi> for the receiving of remiſſion of ſinnes, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified, he preacheth unto them onely, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turne to God, and doe workes meet for repentance, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt. And in this conſiſted all the preaching of all the Apoſtles and Prophets, and this is all the worke that the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt have to doe, unto the end of the world. Which Commiſſion when the Church of England fully and punctually obſerveth, teaching them to repent, and turne from ſinne, and idols, unto the living God, and to change their minds and purpoſes, and to come out of themſelves, and flie unto God for mercy and pardon, puting off their old mind, and putting on a new; in a word, when the Church of England teacheth all men that true repentance conſiſts in the univerſall change of the mind, and of the whole life, and turning unto God by unfeigned ſorrow, which proceedeth from an earneſt, ſerious, and reall feare of God, which continueth unto the laſt houre of mans life, in the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the old man, and crucifying of the fleſh, and in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the new man, and vivifying of the Spirit, and labours by all meanes to humble men for their ſinnes, by which they have offended
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:158688:35"/>God, that ſo they may obtaine mercy, and become new creatures, and manifeſt this change wrought in them, by the amendment of their whole lives, and returning into the waies of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and exhorteth them to the practiſing of all thoſe vertues and graces God hath adorned them with, and beſtowed upon them, and as they <hi>are a choſen generation, a Royall Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people, that they ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſſe into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. verſ. 9. Againe, when the Church of England inſtructeth the people fully in the doctrine of ſaving faith, teaching that it is a certaine, ſetled, and aſſured knowledge of the free grace, mercy, and love of God towards mankinde, in Jeſus Chriſt, and grounded upon the truth of the gracious and free promiſe of God in Chriſt, and is both revealed unto their minds and ſoules, and ſealed in their hearts by the holy Ghoſt, ſo that as the Spirit of God doth illuminate their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, &amp; worketh faith in their hearts, withall he doth witneſſe unto them their adoption, and aſſureth them of their ſalvation in Jeſus Chriſt, and of life eternall, according unto the Commiſſion delivered unto the Apoſtles, and which likewiſe they in their own particulars preached unto their auditors, as the whole Scriptures witneſſe, now when the Church of England, I ſay, not onely inſtructeth the people rightly to believe and repent, but alſo calleth upon them that they ſhould joyne practiſe with theory, and ſhew forth their faith by all good workes and a godly life, and holy converſation, and that they ſhould daily increaſe and abound in all knowledge, and labour for particular faith, and certaine aſſurance of Gods love, and that they may the better attaine unto this ſpeciall aſſurance, by which they may be ſupported in all temptations and tryals, they exhort them diligently and carefully to read the Word of God which was <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, Rom.</hi> 15. ver. 4. and call upon them likewiſe to be diligent in the hearing of the holy Word, and frequenting of the holy aſſemblies, and encourage them to the reall practice of all thoſe inſtructions and wholſome doctrines that they learne by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpell, that they may not only be Saints in the Church, and in publique, but at home in their houſes, yea and in their private cloſets, and be holy in all manner of converſation, both publique and private, ever inſtructing their family, ever ſhewing them good example, and going before them in a godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:158688:36"/>life, walking before God in uprightneſſe, &amp; inall ſincerity, and before men unreproveable. Again, when the Church of England adminiſters the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt inſtitution, without addition and diminution; but as they have received them from the Lord: as baptiſme in pure water, without mixtures: and the Lords Supper in both elements in Bread and Wine, with the very words of inſtitution according to Chriſts appointment and command: And withall continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs and teaches the people the end for which they were ordained, and the right uſe of them, with the true nature and meaning of thoſe myſteries, as that they are outward and viſible ſignes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord ſealeth and confirmeth to our conſciences the ſweet promiſes of his good will and pleaſure towards us, for the ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſupporting of the feebleneſſe and weakeneſſe of our faith: and by the which we againe on our owne behalfes doe teſtifie our piety, duty, and love towards him, as well before him and the bleſſed Angels, as before men: and declare unto the people, that they are teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods favour and good will towards us, confirmed by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes, and are viſible forms of inviſible grace. And the Miniſters of the Church of England alſo prepare the people by wholſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions what duties are required at their hands, and what requiſits are neceſſarily expected for the making of them capable, and worthy partakers of theſe holy Ordinances, and ſo to communicate in them, as they may thereby bring glory to God, and edification to others, &amp; receive the comfort of the right celebrating the holy Sacraments in their own particular, all which things, I ſay, when the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> conſcientiouſly performeth, according unto the rule preſcribed in the holy Word, and the example of Chriſt and the holy Apoſtles, it is manifeſt that the Church of England declareth it ſelfe to be a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believeth as it ought to believe. Againe, when the Church of England tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the people to put up all their prayers and ſupplications to God onely, in the name and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the holy Spirit, with an aſſured faith of being heard accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts direction, ſaying, <hi>When ye pray ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 6. ver. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. ver. 22. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall aske in prayer, if ye believe, ye ſhall receive it.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 15. ver. 7. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. ver. 14. and <hi>John</hi> 14. verſ. 13, 14. <hi>Whatſoever ye aske in my name, I will doe it.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 16. ver. 23. <hi>I ſay unto you, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:158688:36"/>ye ſhall aske the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 14. ver. 6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man commeth unto the Father, but by me.</hi> This way of praying unto God doth the Church of England teach unto the people, and inſtruct them, to whom in all calamities to make their addreſſes, according to the doctrine of holy Scripture, and that is to God alone. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call upon me in the time of trouble, &amp;c.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ch. 2. exhorting all Chriſtians to make prayers and ſupplications with thankſgiving for all men, for Kings, and ſuch as are in authority; and giving the reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God will that all men ſhall be ſaved, and come unto the knowledge of the truth</hi> that is to ſay, all ſorts of men, without any difference of nation, kind, age, or order. And then he gives them a direction in whoſe name they ſhall put up their ſupplications, that they may be accepted, and that is in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, No man commeth unto the father, but by Chriſt. And therefore the Apoſtle, as he did impoſe upon all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that duty of praying for all ſorts of men, Kings, Emperours, and Rulers, ſo in that very place, verſ. 5. he bids them put up their prayers in the ſole name of Jeſus Chriſt, for ſaith he, <hi>there is but one God,</hi> to whom we muſt pray, <hi>and there is but one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in whoſe name we muſt put up all our prayers, ſupplications, and thankſgivings. For as there is but one God of all Nations, Kings, Princes, and Potentates, ſo there is but one Mediator of all Nations, Kings, Princes, and Potentates, who onely hath given a ranſome for them, and whoſe blood ſpeaketh better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> for <hi>Abels</hi> cals for revenge, but Chriſts blood cals for mercy, and atonement, and that continually: for he is a perfect Mediator both for ſatisfaction and interceſſion, and hath not reſigned that office of interceſſion and mediatorſhip to either Saints or Angels; and therefore it is great impiety and horrid ſacriledge, and blaſphemy in any, to rob Chriſt of his honour and glory, and to aſcribe it to the creatures, eſpecially when in expreſſe words the Apoſtle in the <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ver. 34. affirmes, that <hi>Chriſt being at the right hand of God maketh requeſts for us.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 2. v. 1, 2. ſaith, <hi>My little children, theſe things write I unto you, that you ſinne not: and if any man ſinne, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the juſt, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not for ours onely, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world.</hi> Here Chriſt is aſſigned by Saint <hi>John</hi> to be the Mediator of all ſorts
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:158688:37"/>of men, of all ages, and in all places, and in that he nominates Jeſus Chriſt to be the Mediator, he excludes all other advocates: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation and interceſſion go inſeparably together, to give us to underſtand that he onely is our advocate, who is our high Prieſt. The ſame doctrine the authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> teaches all Chriſtians in Chap. 5. v. 23, 24, 25. <hi>And they truely were many Prieſts, &amp;c. by reaſon of death but this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath an everlaſting Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Wherefore alſo he is able to ſave them to the utmoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth, and maketh interceſſion for them.</hi> From all which places we ſee, that the Prieſtly Office hath them ediation and interceſſion ſo annexed unto it, that the one cannot be ſevered or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the other without deteſtable ſacriledge and blaſphemy: and therefore it muſt needs be a greater impiety in all ſuch as give the glory of the mediation and interceſſion, to Saints and Angels: when notwithſtanding in expreſſe words the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> chap. 2. v. 18. hath not onely condemned it as dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, but ſhewes likewiſe the reaſon of it, that it is pernicious and deſtructive to the ſoules of men, and ſeparates them from their head Chriſt Jeſus; his words are theſe, <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility, and worſhiping of Angels, &amp;c. and not holding the head.</hi> Here we ſee the reward of ſuch mens impiety, for as they rob Chriſt of his honour, and thruſt him from his mediatorſhip, ſo they by this are thruſt out of Heaven not holding the head. And in <hi>John</hi> 10. ver. 9. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the doore, by me if any man enter in he ſhall be ſaved, &amp;c.</hi> in the which words there are two things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the firſt, that Chriſt onely is the doore of Heaven, no entrance but by him, according to that of Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 4. ver. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for among men there is given no other name under Heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> The ſecond thing out of theſe words obſervable is this, that they that enter in by this doore ſhall be ſaved, and by no other meanes, for <hi>John</hi> 14. ver. 6. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man commeth unto the Father but by me.</hi> In which words Chriſt doth not onely teach us, that he is the way, but aſſerts, that there is no other way to come unto God but by him, if we will be ſaved: therefore whatſoever waies to ſalvation either men doe deviſe and invent, or the devill ſuggeſts, to abuſe the world, God hath appointed no other way to Heaven, and to be ſaved by, but Jeſus Chriſt alone, he onely is the Mediator both of Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. verſ. 18. <hi>For through him we both have
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:158688:37"/>an acceſſe by one ſpirit unto the Father,</hi> And in chap. 3. v. 12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence by the faith of him;</hi> what neede then, have men of any other Mediator, ſeeing that the Son Jeſus Chriſt makes the Father propitious and favorable unto us, and ſeeing that entring in by the doore we attaine unto ſalvation, which is the end of our hope? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. When Chriſt aſcended into Heaven, he promiſed his Apoſtles to ſend them his holy Spirit the Comforter, which ſhould lead them into all truth, and ſolace them and helpe them in all their tribulations, and S <hi>Paul</hi> in the 8 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 26. ſaith, <hi>Likewiſe alſo the Spirit helpes our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, and hee that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the Will of God.</hi> Now let us take notice, how the Spirit of God teacheth all men to pray, who knoweth beſt what is the Will of God. <hi>Yee have not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, verſe 15. <hi>received the Spirit of bondage againe to feare, but yee have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby yee cry Abba, Father,</hi> that is, with earneſtneſſe to cry Father, Father. Thoſe then that call upon Saints and Angels, have not as yet received the ſpirit of adoption, who teacheth them alwayes to direct their Prayers unto God, and to cry Father, Father; but the Spirit of error and deluſion. And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. v. 6. <hi>Becauſe yee are Sonnes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Sonne into your hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> From the which words as from the former, it is eaſy to conclude, that they that teach men to call upon Saints and Angels are not guided and moved by the Spirit of God and Chriſt: for all the Prayers that the Spirit of God and Chriſt frame in our hearts, are addreſſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto God alone. Withall, we may obſerve in both the places cited, that the Spirit teacheth us, not onely to ſay, but makes us cry Abba Father, thereby inſtructing us to caſt away all vaine feares, and to come unto God with confidence and all aſſurance, according to that in the. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. v. 15, 16. <hi>For we have not an High-Prieſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> Let us therefore come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, <hi>that we may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede.</hi> Here againe we are directed to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God only and to our Mediator when we approach to the Throne of grace, neither can we addreſſe ourſelves to any other, better than
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:158688:38"/>unto Chriſt, in regard that he beſt knowes our neceſſities; before <hi>whom there is not any creature that is not manifeſt, and in whoſe ſight with whom we have to doe, all things are naked and open:</hi> neither is there any that has more compaſſion, and is more touched with a feeling of our infirmities, than hee who was in all points tempted like as we; neither is there any that has more ability, and all-ſufficiency to ſuccour, help, or ſave us than Chriſt, who has all power in Heaven and Earth given him for the good of his people, and reliefe of his Church. And in regard likewiſe that all our Prayers, Supplications, and Thanksgivings, are ſpirituall Sacrifices, and all Sacrifices ought only to be offered to God alone, and that in the name and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. As <hi>Judges</hi> 13. v. 16. <hi>If thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou muſt offer it to God alone. Pſal.</hi> 50. v. 14. <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vowes unto the moſt High, and call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver thee:</hi> here we ſee that all Thanksgivings and prayſes muſt be given to him onely, to whom wee put up our Prayers, and according to this rule, have all the holy Prophets: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and all the Saints powred out their Prayers and Praiſes to God alone in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and have directed others ſo to do, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. v. 20. <hi>Giving thankes alwayes for all things unto God even the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. v. 5. <hi>Yee alſo, as lively ſtones, be made a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall houſe, an holy Prieſt-Hood, to offer up ſpirituall Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore they will not be acceptable, except they be offered up in the name of Jeſus Chriſt. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. v. 15. <hi>Let us therefore by him offer the ſacrifice of prayſe alwayes to God, that is the fruit of the lips, giving thanks to his name.</hi> So that if we wil follow the direction of God the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, and be taught by God as all believers are, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. v. 45. then all our prayers, Supplications and Thanksgivings are to be put up to God alone, in the name and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, and by the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit. And this is the Doctrine that all true Chriſtians are bound to perſevere and continue in, to the laſt drop of their bloud, and if an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach us any other doctrine, as invocation of Saints and Angels, he is to be accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. v. 8. The Apoſtle in that place, alluding unto that which is ſpoken in the firſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 13. where the Prophet ſent by the Lord to cry againſt the Altar of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> was commanded not to eate bread, or drinke water, nor to returne the ſame way; and ſo he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:158688:38"/>the King, inviting him to goe to his houſe, that if he would give him halfe his houſe, that he would not go with him, and gave him a reaſon of his ſo doing, becauſe he had a command to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by God himſelfe. But when an old Prophet that dwelt in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> had heard what happened there, and what had beene done to the Altar and <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and being deſirous to give him entertainment, and for that end following the Prophet at laſt he overtook him, and earneſtly intreated him to returne and eate Bread, who reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him ſayd, <hi>I may not returne with thee, nor eate bread, for it was ſaid unto mee by the Word of the Lord to the contrary; to whom the old Prophet anſwered, I am a Prophet as well as thou, and an Angel ſpake unto me by the Word of the Lord,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Bring him back with thee into the houſe that he may eate Bread, and drinke Water, but he lyed.</hi> And by this lie, he deluded the poore Prophet to his ruin, as the ſtory telleth, &amp; to this ſtory, I ſay, the Apoſtle alluding, forbiddeth all Chriſtians to take heed of all other Doctrines whatſoever that they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt and his Diſciples, and that they intertaine none contrary to that they have beene taught by him, though he himſelfe ſhould teach contrary to that he formerly taught, or any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, yea though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach them otherwiſe, the Apoſtle ties all Chriſtians here as in other places, to the rule written in the Word of God. And in Chap. 6. in the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Tim. v. 3. <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not unto wholſome words, even the Words of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine which is according to godlineſſe: from ſuch withdraw thy ſelfe.</hi> Now to teach invocations of Saints and Angels is to teach otherwiſe, than Chriſt taught, and it is not to conſent unto wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus, who ſaid, when yee pray ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> But we cannot ſay to any Saint or Angel, <hi>our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name thy Kingdome come, thy will be done, and forgive us our ſinnes, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore by Chriſts Doctrine wee are in our Prayers to pray onely unto him, to whom all theſe Petitions belong, and this is to conſent unto the wholeſome words of Chriſt, and to the Doctrine which is according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that all Praying to Saints and Angels is unwholeſome doctrine, yea impious and blaſphemous, and by the command of the Apoſtle wee are to ſhun ſuch as bring ſuch Doctrine; according to that of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Epiſtle the 2. verſ. 9.10, 11. <hi>Whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt hath not God. He that abideth in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:158688:39"/>the Doctrine of Chriſt, hee bath both the Father and the Sonne. If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine</hi>) that is to ſay, the Doctrine of Chriſt) <hi>receive him not into your Houſe, neither bid him God-ſpeed. For he that biddeth him God-ſpeede, is partaker of his evill deeds.</hi> They that teach therefore the Doctrin of the invocation of Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels teach not the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and they that entertaine and imbrace that Doctrine, they all tranſgreſſe the command and have not God; but they that teach the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt which is in all our neceſſities to call upon God the Father, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they have both the Father and the Sonne, and by that, ſalvation; for they that call upon the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth this, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Innumerable reaſons, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> might be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Doctrine of invocating of Saints and Angels, as that it is a meere will-worſhip, without both preſident and precept, and whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne, but much more whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the wholeſome words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto Faith: <hi>for how ſhall they call on him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in whom they have not believed?</hi> ſo that faith and invocation goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we muſt call upon none in whom wee believe not: but to believe in Saints and Angells is both blaſphemous and impious, for it is to give the honour due to the Creator, who is bleſſed for ever, to the creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. than the which there cannot be a greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; and it is alſo to expect ſalvation from them, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God alone, who only can ſave: <hi>for whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lordſhall be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10. v. 13. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. v. 32. Now if by our Prayer unto God, we can be ſaved, what neede wee take then any other courſe as to go either to Saints or Angells, if it were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbidden, nor ſinfull? but ſeeing it is a doctrine againſt the Will of God, and every way ſo abominable, it ought of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be deteſted: and ſo much the rather, becauſe they that make Saints and Angels Mediators of the new Teſtament, ſaying, that Chriſt is Mediator of ſatisfaction and redemption, but that the Saints and Angels are mediators of interceſſion, by this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Doctrine, they make Chriſt but a partiall, momentany and temporary Mediator, and his Mediatorſhip but for a time: and give unto the Saints and Angells, that never dying and everlaſting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, than the which there is nothing more impious againſt God, or injurious to men, when notwithſtanding the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:158688:39"/>proclaime Chriſts Mediatorſhip to conſiſt as well in interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as redemption, and that they cannot be ſeparated or divided, and alſo that Chriſt now at the right hand of God is Mediator of both, who is the appointed advocate and high-prieſt for this purpoſe in Heaven, and that by God himſelfe who is Judge there, and to which Office none can be admitted but by God alone, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. v. 4. &amp; 5. And withall the holy Word of God in expreſſe tearmes delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto all Chriſtians for their comfort, that Chriſt doth now make interceſſion for them at the right hand of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. v. 31. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24, 25. &amp; the 1 of <hi>John</hi> chap. 2. v. 1, 2. Now then I ſay al theſe things conſidered, when in the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Goſpell is purely and ſincerely preached, the Sacraments duly and rightly adminiſtred in all reſpects and the Name of God truly called upon, according as God himſelfe hath appointed: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a true Church, and when in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Goſpell is neither purely and ſincerely preached, but error, ſuperſtition and open Idolatry, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are adulterated by additions and detractions, mingling with their Sacrament of Baptiſme, Spitle, Oyle and Salt, making it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a plaſter than a Baptiſme, and mangling the Lords Supper moſt ſacrilegiouſly; firſt taking away the Cup from the People, and then changing the Sacrament into a ſacrifice, that abominable Idoll of the Maſſe, to the which they give the worſhip of <hi>Latriae,</hi> which in their Dialect is onely due to God alone: and when they have to all this brought into the Church the invocation of Saints and Angels, and by this meanes robbed Chriſt and God of their honour, and ſet up a falſe worſhip, and perſecute all thoſe that Preach the Goſpell, and hinder men from the faith, it neceſſarily followeth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church, the ground and pillar of Truth, but the foundation of all error and abomination, and by that meanes have made themſelves liable to the curſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Galatians</hi> denounceth againſt all ſuch as Preach otherwiſe than hee hath taught: and that curſe alſo he pronounces againſt <hi>Bar-Jeſus</hi> the Sorcerer in the 13 of the <hi>Act.</hi> who withſtood <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ſeeking to turne away the Deputy from the faith, verſ. 9. To whom <hi>Paul, filled with the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, O full of all ſubtilty and all miſchiefe, thou child of the Devill, thou enemy of all righteouſneſſe, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the wayes of the Lord?</hi> So that you ſee, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> owne words thoſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:158688:40"/>that hinder the Preaching of the Goſpell, pervert the wayes of God: and for ſo doing, are by the holy Apoſtle proclaimed children of the Devill and enemies of all Righteouſneſſe. And in the firſt of <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ch. 2. Heare what the Apoſtle there ſpeakes of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and conſider diligently whether that which he there declareth doth not belong unto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> his words are theſe, verſ. 23. <hi>Who both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own Prophets; and have perſecuted us: and they pleaſe not God and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſinnes alwayes, for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> Thoſe that perſecute the true Miniſters of the Goſpell and all true believers under the name of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, and hinder and forbid the peaching of the Goſpel, they neither pleaſe God, and are contrary to all men, and fill up their ſinnes alwayes: for the wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermoſt, and therefore they are not the Church of God but enemies to him, and contrary to all men; and all this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> dayly practiſeth: but the Church of <hi>England</hi> when it doth not pervert the wayes of the Lord, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not nor forbids the Preaching of the Goſpell, but ſincerely and purely preacheth it, that all men may be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth, and prompteth and furthereth the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, all it can poſſibly, and rightly adminiſtreth the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the which there is the true invocation of God, it is manifeſt that it is a true Church, the ground and pillar of Truth, and where ſalvation may be had. And thus much Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I thought fit to ſpeake of all the ſeverall parts of that Syllogiſme, which you excepted againſt, and I am moſt aſſured, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall ſeriouſly weigh the things handled in it, will thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuperfluous in all I have ſayd: and with all will find every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of it ſo confirmed and corroborated, as it will give him good ſatisfaction and illucidate that every Branch of that argument is true. But becauſe, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> after your exception you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the whole minor in a bulke all together, I will now make that good alſo in the groſſe. And that the order of our diſputation may the better be obſerved, which by reaſon of this large diſcourſe hath beene ſomething obſcured and interrupted, I will briefly repeate the ſum of the argument and what you denied in it, and ſo goe on. The argument was this: <hi>That Church that teacheth the Way, the Truth and the Life, againſt which the gates of Hell can never prevaile, is a true
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:158688:40"/>Church, the ground and pillar of Truth. But the Church of</hi> England <hi>teacheth the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Ergo.</hi> Here you deny the Minor, which I thus prove. <hi>That Church which is built upon the foundation of</hi> Peter, <hi>teacheth the Way, the Truth and the Life, &amp;c. But the Church of</hi> England <hi>is built upon the foundation of Peter, Ergo.</hi> Here alſo you denyed the Minor, which I thus proved. <hi>That Church which acknowledgeth Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the Eternall living God, and believeth onely in Him for ſalvation, renouncing all merit, will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, bumane inventions in Gods Service, and continues ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the which the Goſpell is purely Preached, repentance towards God, &amp; faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is the true invocation of God, that Church is built upon the foundation of Peter, and teaches the Way, the Truth and the Life, and is a true Church, the ground and pillar of Truth. But the Church of</hi> England <hi>doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of the Eternall living God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves onely on Him for ſalvation, renouncing all Merits, Will-worſhip, Humane inventions in Gods Service, and continues ſtedfaſtly in the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the which the Goſpell is purely Preached, Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which alſo there is the true invocation of God. Ergo, It is built upon the foundation of Peter, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Minor you alſo peremptorely denied, which I then proved, &amp; wil now by Gods aſſiſtance make good, and anſwer to all your evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in order, and then prove the Scripture to containe all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and to be the only rule of our faith and manners. <hi>That Church which acknowledgeth both the natures of Ieſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and ſo believes in him, as he is qualified and made knowne in the Goſpell, renouncing all merits and will-worſhip, and relies onely upon Chriſt for ſalvation, and obſerves all the other requiſites ſpecified in my Minor, that Church is built upon the foundation of Peter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as it ought to believe.</hi> But the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and ſo believes in him, as he is qualified and made knowne in the Goſpell, renouncing all Merits, Will-worſhip, and relies onely upon Chriſt for ſalvation, and obſerves all the other requiſites ſpecified in my Minor. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and believes as it ought to believe, and is a true Church, the ground and pillar of Truth, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:158688:41"/>
            <p> They, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that were ſtanders by, admired you ſhould deny ſuch apparent truths, as you then did in your anſwers to my former Syllogiſmes, the verity of the which, as they ſaid, was ſo evident and well known to very children. But they much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to heare your expreſſions in this your laſt anſwer to my laſt Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme. And to ſpeake the truth, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> and no way to wrong you, your anſwer was not onely very confuſed, but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly erroneous in all reſpects, to ſpeake no more. I ſay it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed not onely in that you neither denied major nor minor, nor any part of it directly, as you had done in your former replies, and anſwers; for that indeed you could not now doe, the truth was ſo cleare: but in regard alſo of the obſcurity of your expreſſions, and your often affirming and denying the ſame thing, of which you could give no reaſon to thoſe Gentlemen that were preſent, although they often deſired it. I will therefore firſt ſet downe as well as I can the ſum of your anſwer, and bring that into order that was confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly by you delivered: and then relate the ſeverall arguments and reaſons I then made to your evaſions.</p>
            <p>Your firſt evaſion was, That to acknowledge both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt and all his Offices, and to believe in him as he was ſet forth and qualified in the holy Scripture, was not ſufficient enough to make a Church to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> And your reaſon, as you ſaid, was, becauſe <hi>to believe in Jeſus Chriſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually and ſufficiently to ſalvation, conſiſted, in that we conformed our ſelves to a beliefe which is ſpeculative, and to a religion that is practicall; in that the Church of Chriſt was determined in theſe two points, to believe what was rightly delivered to us for ſpeculative, and then the externall practice of religion.</hi> I have ſet downe your anſwer, as I finde it taken by thoſe that writ it verbatim, not truſting wholly to my owne memory. But before I relate the anſwer I then gave you, I will firſt diſcover the danger and obſcurity, yea confuſion that is in your language and words, by which you thought to evade the dint of my argument: the truth of which, all the force and wit of man can never prevaile againſt. You firſt affirmed, that it was not enough to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> to acknowledge both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and to believe in him as he was ſet forth and qualified in holy Scripture: for otherwiſe, to what end were theſe your words uttered to evade the force and dint of my argument? And this is as much as to overthrow all
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:158688:41"/>Chriſtian religion, and to deny the holy Scripture, which offers ſalvation upon the termes of believing Jeſus Chriſt, as he is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made knowne in the Goſpell: for <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 2. v. 2. <hi>I determined not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> A ſublimer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a more excellent learning <hi>Paul</hi> aſpired not unto, than to the knowledge of Chriſt and him crucified, and that indeed is a knowledge ſurpaſſing all knowledge, having both the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to come, and brings a man to eternall happineſſe: <hi>For this is life eternall,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>to know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> tell me I beſeech you, wherein doth the knowledge of Chriſt conſiſt, but in underſtanding this, <hi>that when he was in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equall with God, he made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men, Phil.</hi> 2. ver. 6, 7. So that being both God and man, he became our Mediator, and hath <hi>viſited and redeemed his people, and is the horne of our ſalvation,</hi> as he is deſcribed in the firſt of <hi>Luke</hi> v. 68, 69. that hath overcome and vanquiſhed all our enemies by his power, as he was our King, and has made our atonement with God, as he was our Prieſt, being our Mediator both of ſatisfaction and interceſſion: and in that as our Prophet, the wiſdome of the Father, he hath fully declared the will of his heavenly Father in his holy Word, according to the which we ought to ſquare and order our lives: in the diſtinct knowledge of all which things, and believing and practiſing what is declared in the holy Scripture, is the whole worke of a Chriſtian, and the onely cauſe of building any upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> And yet in your dialect, Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> there is more required in a Chriſtian to make him believe aright, than to acknowledge both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and to believe in him as he is ſet forth unto us, and declared in his holy Word, which is indeed to overthrow all Chriſtian religion, though perhaps you intended no ſuch thing. But they, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> that will oppoſe the truth many times expoſe themſelves to great danger, running into many errours. But let us heare the reaſon of that your aſſertion, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to believe in Jeſus Chriſt effectually and ſufficiently to ſalvation, conſiſts in this, that we conforme our ſelves to a beliefe which is ſpeculative, and to a religion that is practicall, in regard that the Church of Chriſt was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:158688:42"/>in theſe two points, to believe what is rightly delivered to us for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, and then the externall practice of Religion.</hi> By all which if you had underſtood, that in true Religion theory and practice muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies goe together, and that they were inſeparable, there had been no controverſie between you and me: but the very truth is, there is a myſtery of iniquity in your expreſſions. For what can any man underſtand by your words, when you ſay, to believe in Chriſt Jeſus effectually and ſufficiently to ſalvation, conſiſts in that we conforme our ſelves to a beliefe which is ſpeculative, and to a religion which is practicall, if you meane not by your beliefe ſpeculative, and your religion practicall, the knowledge of both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and to believe in him, as he is qualified and ſet downe to us in his holy Word, and the ordering of our lives according to the rule and direction of the ſame; which is all that true religion conſiſts in? Now, I ſay, if you make your beliefe ſpeculative, and your religion practicall, a thing divers and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the knowledge of both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, and relying onely upon him for ſalvation, and believing in him as he is qualified and declared to us in the Goſpell, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving according to the rule of his holy Word, then of neceſſity you bring in a new religion of your owne, altogether unknowne to the Chriſtian world; a ſpeculative beliefe, and a practicall religion, which doth not conſiſt in the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt, and the knowledge of our ſelves, in which onely conſiſteth life eternall. So that, to ſpeake the truth, you are in Babylon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion it ſelfe. And now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I come to the anſwers I then made, and gave to your evaſions: but by the way, I cannot but put you in mind of a promiſe you made me upon my demand, which was this, if I ſhould clearely and evidently prove unto you, that the Church of England taught all thoſe things for ſpeculation and practice that made us believe effectually and ſufficiently to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether or no it would then ſatisfie you and perſwade you that the Church of England was built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and was a true Church? And if my memory faile not, you told me that then the worke was done. Whereupon, I thus argued:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church that declares, preaches, and teaches, unto the people, all that Jeſus Chriſt both taught, did, and ſuffered for the ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, after he had taken humane nature upon him, as he was our King,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:158688:42"/>Prieſt, and Prophet, which is all that we are to believe for the ſpeculative part: and declares likewiſe, and preaches plainly and diſtinctly, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever concernes the peoples dutie of love and obedience to God againe, for his infinite love to mankind: and inſtructs them in like manner of their duty of love and charity one towards another, all which belongs unto the practicall part of religion: that Church teacheth all things both for theory and practice neceſſary for ſalvation, and building them upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peter. But the Church of England doth all this: ergo.</hi> Here, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> you denied my minor; then many of the Gentlemen that were ſtanders by, Sir <hi>Francis Wortly,</hi> Sir <hi>John Gothericke,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Biſhop,</hi> and others whoſe names I know not, demanded of you, ſeeing you denied my minor, that you would declare and ſpecifie wherein the Church of England failed, either in the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative or practicall part of Divinity, and wherein ſhe was ſilent in any thing that was neceſſary to ſalvation, either for theory or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And you were not then able, as they can all witneſſe, to ſhew any particular, where the Church of England failed in her duty, or concealed any thing from the people, either for ſpeculation or practice. Notwithſtanding, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> you yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the deniall of my minor, and put me upon my proofe. Wherupon I thus argued. <hi>That Church that teaches the whole counſell of God, the knowledge of the onely true God, and whom he hath ſent Jeſus Chriſt, which is life eternall, John</hi> 17. <hi>and teſtifies unto the people repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Acts</hi> 20. v. 21. <hi>and inſtructs them in all things how to believe aright, and how to obey aright: that Church teacheth all things for theory and practice that are requiſite for the making of a true Church, and for the building of it upon the foundation of Peter. But the Church of England teacheth all theſe things: ergo.</hi> You againe denied my minor, whereupon the Gentlemen as before, deſired you to inſtance in any particular, where the Church of England was defective or failed in declaring the full counſell of God, or in preaching the knowledge of God, or of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to the people. And however, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> you were not able in any particular to make it appeare where the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was deficient, yet you continued in deniall of my minor, and urged me to prove it: when nevertheleſſe, the truth of it is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as very children are able to diſcerne it. All men know, that faith and obedience is the whole duty of man. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> was well inſtructed in this doctrine, and taught it to all his people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:158688:43"/>chap. 20. v. 20. where he ſaith, <hi>Heare ye me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jeruſalem, believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his holy Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper. And whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be confounded, Eſay</hi> 28.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. verſ. 33. Faith and obedience was the theame of all the Sermons of all the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and of Chriſt himſelfe, as the whole Scriptures witneſſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. v. 19. the Prophet ſaith, <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eate the good of the Land: but if ye refuſe and rebell, you ſhall be deſtroyed with the Sword:</hi> all which proofes cleere the truth of my argument. But to ſatisfie your then deſire, I prove my minor thus: <hi>That Church that teaches the people their whole duty, both towards God, and one towards another, and inſtructs them both what they ſhould doe, and what they ſhould leave undone, by the obſerving of the which they may live happily here, and come to life eternall hereafter: that Church teacheth the whole counſell of God, all for theory and practice, that is neceſſary for the making of it a true Church, and the building of it up upon the foundation of Peter. But the Church of England doth all this: Ergo.</hi> And for proofe of my minor I cited that of <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 2. v. 11. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath appeared unto all men, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching us, that denying ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly, and holily in this preſent world: looking for that bleſſed hope, and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelfe for us, that he might redeeme us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people, zealous of good workes.</hi> Many places more may be cited to confirme the truth of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. verſ. 13, 14. where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let us heare the concluſion of the whole matter, feare God and keepe his Commandements, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> So in like manner, in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. ver. 13, 14, 15. <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I ſhould ſinne againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way. Onely feare the Lord, and ſerve him in truth, with all your heart: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great things he hath done for you. But if you ſtill doe wickedly, ye ſhall be conſumed, both ye and your King.</hi> The truth of my minor is ſo cleare, that there is not a man in whom there is but one eye of reaſon, but can eaſily perceive and diſcerne it: for the Church of England teacheth and publiſheth the whole Law, and the whole Goſpell, and all that is contained in the whole written Word of God both in the old and new Teſtament, and therefore all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God, and all both for theory and practice, and whatſoever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:158688:43"/>is neceſſary for the building of men up upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and proving it ſelfe a true Church. But when you were by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus urged, you at laſt, after many windings and turnings, betooke your ſelfe to the common refuge of all thoſe of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to wit, to an unwritten word, your traditions, and affirmed that the Scriptures contained not all things that were to be learned and practiſed by the people, and that the people ought to be as well acquainted with that, as with the written Word: whereupon Sir <hi>John Gotherick</hi> a learned Gentleman, to aſſert and maintaine the alſufficiency of the Scripture, without the addition of mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cited that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 3. v. 16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, and for inſtruction, &amp;c.</hi> The force of which argument, you had thought by a gloſſe and flouriſh to have evaded, but all the cunning of man cannot doe it, as in its due place will appeare. But after you had once got your head into this fort and refuge, you uttered many things very erroneous, equalizing your traditions, yea preferring them before the written Word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the Scripture of imperfection, and denying them that due honour, which is to be the rule of our faith and manners, and the ſquare by which we muſt order our lives: affirming further more, that they were accidentally written, and not on purpoſe, to be the rule of our doctrine and manners; and that for the making of the Scripture a compleat and abſolute rule, the unwritten word recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and entertained in all ages by tradition, ought to be added to it, which when the Church of England did not obſerve and admit of, it did not believe as Chriſt ordained, and as it ought to believe for the ſpeculative and practicall parts of Divinity; for to believe in Chriſt effectually and ſufficiently to ſalvation, as you ſaid, was not enough to believe both the natures of Jeſus Chriſt, and all his Offices, but it conſiſted in this, that we conforme our ſelves to a beliefe ſpeculative, and to a religion that is practicall: for the Church was determined in theſe two points: that is to ſay, without the Church of England would imbrace and entertaine your tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and believe your unwritten verities, as they are commonly termed, it could not be a true Church. Hereupon, I then under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to maintaine and prove, firſt, that the written Word in it ſelfe without any unwritten verities or traditions, contained all things neceſſary to ſalvation. Secondly, that all Chriſtians were
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:158688:44"/>tied to make that, and that only, the rule of their faith and manners, which you ſaid, if I could prove, you would be a Proteſtant; and after ſome debate of theſe buſineſſes, and that Sir <hi>John Gotherick</hi> had ſaid unto you, (magnifying your unwritten verities,) that if you could make it appeare that you had as good warrant for your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as we could ſhew for the Scriptures, that then he would receive and imbrace them; to whom you replyed, that you could prove them by better authority than he could prove the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the Word of God. But I perceiving at that time, that you grew ſomething weary, and ſeeing withall for want of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, that things began ſomething diſorderly to be handled, I told you that I would by writing reduce all thoſe things that were then agitated and bring them into good order, and ſet downe ſuch other arguments as ſhould ſufficiently prove the Church of England to be a true Church, and ſend you them all in writing; which you not onely liked well of, but earneſtly alſo deſired me ſo to doe: and I promiſed likewiſe, in the ſame writing evidently to prove, that the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, without any traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contained all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation; and that they are the onely rule and ſquare which we are tied unto for the ordering of our faith, lives and manners, which is now my taske that in the following diſcourſe I have taken upon me: and I doubt not, by Gods aſſiſtance, but to make good and maintaine what I have undertaken. But before I come to that, that all men may ſee the Church of England faileth in nothing neceſſary to ſalvation, either in reſpect of theory or practice, although I have formerly proved it, yet I thought fit briefly againe to runne over, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what ſhe teaches for her <hi>beliefe ſpeculative, and her religion practicall</hi> (that I may make uſe of ſome of your expreſſions) and wherein ſhe differs from the Church of Rome; that the Church of Englands tenent, being ſet downe on the one ſide, and the errours and idolatry of the Church of Rome on the other, all men may learne to love and imbrace the Church of England, and to abhorre and abandon the Church of Rome, that mother of abomination: and that you, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that have formerly undutifully deſerted and forſaken her, may with the Prodigall returne, and yeild unto her your mother, Chriſtian and wonted duty and obedience. Which I am confident will be more to your true comfort and honour, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing done by you in all your life. And now to begin, I affirm
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:158688:44"/>for <hi>beliefe</hi> ſpeculative, and <hi>religion</hi> practicall, it is orthodoxly and and clearely taught in the Church of England in all points; and to begin with the ſpeculative part.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever, I ſay, is required of us to be knowne, concerning God, is perſpicuouſly taught in the Church of England, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the divine eſſence and nature of God, as alſo of the perſons in the bleſſed Trinity, as likewiſe of their names and workes, and of all their glorious attributes. As that there is but one onely true God, diſtinguiſhed into the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, the al-ſufficient Jehovah, Creator and governour of all things: which onely living God the Church of England with an unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doth honour, ſerve, and worſhip, in ſpirit and truth, as he himſelfe commands, <hi>John</hi> 4. verſ. 24. and as he hath in all ages been worſhipped by all the family of the faithfull, that call upon his name in ſincerity, ſince the glorious aſcenſion of Chriſt into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and teaches the people ſo to worſhip him. The Church of England doth fully likewiſe inſtruct the people, in what a happy and bleſſed condition man was created, being made after Gods owne Image and likeneſſe, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. v. 27. and into what miſery he afterwards plunged himſelfe and all his poſterity, by reaſon of his tranſgreſſion, diſobedience, and infidelity, in liſtning unto the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ll, as it is at large deſcribed in <hi>Geneſ.</hi> chap. 3. And as it doth daily acquaint them with the nature of ſinne, the danger of it, and the evill conſequences that inſue upon it: as all manner of miſeries here, and eternall damnation hereafter, if by timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they breake not off the courſe of them; which duty they daily exhort them unto. In like manner, it teacheth the people that next to the eternall love of God, who in Chriſt Jeſus made choice of them, before the foundation of the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. v. 3, 4, 5. that they owe the whole worke of their redemption unto Jeſus Chriſt alone, who taking humane nature upon him, <hi>was made ſinne for us, that knew no ſinne, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. verſ. 21. So that if we conſider the whole ſumme of our ſalvation, and all the parts of it, they are contained and comprehended in Chriſt, to whom alone all the honour, glory and praiſe of all our bleſſedneſſe both preſent and future is to be aſcribed, and not any parcell of it to be attributed to any creature in Heaven or earth. So that if any deſires to be ſaved, and to be eternally bleſſed, the Church of England inſtructs them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:158688:45"/>there is no other meanes to be ſaved by, but by the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. v. 12. and that Salvation is onely in him. And therefore, if they ſeeke and deſire all ſuch gifts and graces of the holy Spirit, without which they can neither know God, nor believe in him as they ought, the Church of England teaches them, that they are onely to be found in Chriſts unction, <hi>of whoſe fulneſſe we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved grace for grace, John</hi> 1. And if they want ſtrength and power to ſubdue their corruptions, and to ſupport them in temptation: the Church of England teacheth, that they may finde them in Chriſts Dominion and Soveraignty, <hi>to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, Matth.</hi> 28. ver. 18. If they deſire purity and innocency, they have it in his conception. If they deſire mercy, compaſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, they have it in his birth, <hi>Who was made like unto us, that he might have compaſſion on us, and make our reconciliation with God, Heb.</hi> 3. v. 17. If we deſire redemption, we have it in his death and paſſion. If we deſire abſolution and freedome from guilt, we have it in Chriſts condemnation. If we ſeeke a diſcharge or delivery from malediction and the curſe, we have it in his croſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. v. 13. If we ſeeke for ſatisfaction and a full payment unto the wrath and juſtice of God, we have it in his ſacrifice. If we deſire to be purged and cleanſed from all our ſinnes and iniquities, we have it in his blood, 1 <hi>John</hi> chap. 1. v. 7. If we ſeeke for reconciliation, we have it in his bitter agony and ſufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 5. v. 18, 19, 21. If we ſeeke the mortification of the fleſh, and crucifying of the old man, we have it in his grave. And if we deſire and ſeeke for new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life, and vivifying of the Spirit, and immortality, we have them all in his reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. v. 4, 5. And if we ſeeke for the Kingdome of Heaven, we have it in his aſcenſion. And if we looke for ayd and helpe in time of need, and in all our diſtreſſes: or if we deſire plenty, ſufficiency, and the affluency of all good things to ſupply all our wants and neceſſities, we ſhall finde them in his Soveraignty and Kingdome. And if we wait for a joyfull and dreadleſſe expectation of the laſt judgement, we have it in Chriſt, who we know is our Mediator that ſhall be the Judge both of quick and dead, and therefore we doe with joy lift up our heads, knowing that our ſalvation and redemption draweth nigh. In a word, the Church of England teacheth all theſe things to the people, and that all the riches and treaſures of all good things are to be found in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. verſ. 3. and that to him alone they ought to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:158688:45"/>have recourſe, if they would be repleniſhed, and have their wants at any time ſupplied. And whither indeed upon all occaſions, ſhould we flie, but unto Chriſt? for as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayeth, <hi>John</hi> 6. verſ. 68. <hi>Lord to whom ſhall wee goe? thou haſt the words of eternall like.</hi> Therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth all men to make their addreſſes to Chriſt onely, for to him onely is to be aſcribed all the honour and praiſe of our Redemption. And the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath very good reaſon and warrant out of Gods Word, ever to maintaine the truth of this Doctrine, that the whole ſum of our ſalvation, and all the parts of it are onely to be found in Chriſt. For otherwiſe, they cannot yeeld unto God that honour that is due to him, and is to be kept and preſerved inviolably for him without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither can they find<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that peace and comfort in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, if they rely upon any abilitie or forces of their owne, or reſt in any of their own performances, in the which they know there is ſo much imperfection and ſo many failings. And this were but to forſake the fountaine of living waters, and to dig themſelves broken ciſternes which cannot hold a drop of true comfort; beſides all this there is great danger in ſo doing in all reſpects: for to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe or attribute any thing unto themſelves in the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is meere blaſphemy, in that they take away that honour that is wholly and intirely belonging to the Mediator, God bleſſed for ever, and aſcribe it to a meer creature, which is indeed an horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety. For, the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. v. 4. &amp; 6. ſaith, <hi>that the Father hath layd the iniquities of us all upon his Sonne, that by his ſtripes wee ſhould be healed.</hi> Which very thing S. <hi>Peter</hi> in other words expreſſeth, 1 Epiſt. chap. 2. ver. 24. ſaying, <hi>that Chriſt did in his body heare our ſinnes upon the Tree.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 8 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 2, 3. affirmes, <hi>that ſin was condemned in his fleſh, when He was made ſinne for us, and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. v. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. v. 13. That is to ſay, the power, force and curſe of ſin was killed and ſlaine in his fleſh, when hee was offered up and given to be a Sacrifice for us, upon whom the whole heape and maſſe of our ſinnes, with all the curſe and malediction, with the dreadfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and condemnation of death was layd. So that I ſay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> aſcribes all the honour of our redemption to Chriſt alone, and teaches all men, that if in the leaſt thing they ſhould rob Chriſt of his due honour, as it is an inſufferable ſinne and indignity in any to do, ſo by it they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And therefore the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the holy Scriptures attributes the whole worke of our redemption to Chriſt alone, and teaches the people that by his ſtripes they are made whole, and ſo in this ſpeculative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief it fayleth not.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe diligently inſtructeth the people, how they may be made partakers of Chriſt and all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and ſhewes them the way directly of attaining this felicity, and that is by teaching them ſelfe-deniall, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and then it teacheth them alſo, that the ordinary way and meanes of attaining this faith, by which they may ſave their ſoules, is the preaching and hearing of the Word; and as this faith is attained to by hearing, ſo it is dayly increaſed by the ſame, as alſo by the right uſe and adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments and Prayers: to all which duties they ſtir up the people with all ſedulity and godly care; And that they may the more deterre them from ſinne and all manner of evill, they do not onely declare unto them the horror of ſinne and the preſent danger of it, as that it is the cauſe of all miſeries and calamities here, but that it will alſo bring endleſſe and eternall miſery upon them hereafter, and that they muſt all appeare at the laſt day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a dreadfull Judge, there to give <hi>an accompt of whatſoever they have done in the body, whether good or evill,</hi> 2 Cor. chap. 5. verſ. 10. <hi>And that they ſhould not deceive themſelves: for God is not mocked, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reape: for hee that ſoweth unto the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption: but he that ſoweth unto the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reape life everlaſting. Gal.</hi> 6. v. 7, 8. So that if we run through all the Theoricall part of Divinity you ſhall not finde the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:158688:46"/>Church of <hi>England</hi> failing or defective in any point of beliefe ſpeculative, that is required and neceſſary for ſalvation, when it teacheth every thing that Chriſt himſelfe requires at mens hands, that they ſhould know to make them bleſſed. Now all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that makes men bleſſed and that Chriſt injoynes them, is the knowledge of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſelf-deniall. <hi>This is life eternall,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>to know thee to be the only true God and whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And Mat. 16. <hi>If any will be my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, let him deny himſelfe and come after mee.</hi> Now I ſay when the Church of <hi>England</hi> teacheth the people the knowledge of God, in Jeſus Chriſt, and the knowledge of themſelves, it teacheth all things for beliefe ſpeculative, for all ſpeculative Divinity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe two poynts. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke of the Theoricall part of Divinity, wherein the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth her duty.</p>
            <p>And now Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I will as briefly as I can declare and prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> fayleth nothing in teaching all things for Religion practicall: for in that ſhee teacheth us our whole duty, both towards God and towards our Neighbour, what we ſhould doe and what wee ſhould not do, in the whole courſe of our lives, for the pleaſing of God and avoyding of ſin and miſery, ſhe doth her duty alſo in the practicall part of Divinity perfectly and fully; For as all ſpeculative Divinity conſiſts, as I ſayd before, in the knowledge of God and of our ſelves: ſo all practicall Religion conſiſts in the performance of our duty towards God, in giving him his due honour, and ſuch a worſhip and ſervice as he requires of us in his Word, and that is ſpirituall, as wee ſee <hi>John</hi> 4. verſ. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth.</hi> And in performing all offices of love and charity to our Neighbour, and carrying our ſelves unblamably in this preſent World, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. verſ. 27. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iames, before God and the Father, is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and the Widow in their affliction, and to keepe themſelves unſpotted from the World:</hi> and in obſerving and fulfilling that royall Law, chap. 2. verſ. 8. <hi>in loving our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> In theſe two points conſiſts all practicall Religion, which is nothing elſe but a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our whole lives according to the Law of God conſidering that we are not at our owne diſpoſing, nor at our owne liberty, but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:158688:47"/>conſecrated and dedicated unto God: and therefore wee muſt deny our ſelves, and forſake our owne reaſon, and reſigne our ſelves up, to be guided and governed by the Word and Spirit of the Lord in all things belonging unto his worſhip. And that wee ought not to ſeeke after thoſe things that are our owne, but thoſe things that are according to the Will of God, and tend to the advancement of his glory and Kingdom, and in this does our practicall Religion concerning God conſiſt: and our love and duty towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is contained in theſe two things, <hi>in being kindly affectioned one towards another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one another,</hi> Rom. 12. v. 10. <hi>In doing nothing through ſtrife and vaine-glory, but in lowlineſſe of mind, each eſteeming others better than themſelves.</hi> Phil. 2. verſ. 3. And then in imploying our ſelves to the uttermoſt of our abilities, with all ſincerity and truth of affection and unfained love, to procure their good and emolument in all things. And under theſe two heads, the love of God, and of our Neighbour, is compriſed all the practicall Divinity or Religion, the Word of God makes knowne unto men, and requires at our hand. Which when the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth dayly publiſh unto the people, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things concerning them fully, it is aboundantly evident to any unpartiall man, that ſhe teachteh all things both for Theory and practice neceſſary for ſalvation, and for the proving of her ſelfe to to be a true Church, the ground and pillar of truth, and to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter.</hi> And as this concluſion doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily iſſue upon the premiſes, for the proofe of the truth of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> ſo on the contrary, this likewiſe will of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity follow, that, that Church, that neither teacheth thoſe things that belong unto the <hi>beliefe ſpeculative, nor to the Religion practicall,</hi> cannot be a true Church; And I am confident Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that you your ſelfe upon deliberation will not deny it. And then alſo, any man may inferre, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be a true Church, nor the ground and pillar of Truth, when ſhee neither teacheth the people the true knowledge of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, nor the knowledge of themſelves, nor makes knowne unto them, the ſpirituall way of worſhipping him which he requires, nor teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them their love and duty towards God, and towards their Neighbour, which God commands, but with far greater reaſon they may conclude that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a true Church, if
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:158688:47"/>they conſider alſo, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not onely neglecteth her duty in not teaching the people the true knowledge of God and of themſelves: but alſo in that ſhee taketh away the Key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from them, ſnatching the Word of God out of their hands, and hindering the pure preaching of both Law and Goſpel, by which men might be ſaved, and ſetting up an idolatricall worſhip, and bringing in a new ſervice of their owne deviſing: and in that alſo, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not teach the people love towards their Neighbours, the true ſervants of God, but hatred, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates them to perſecute them with fire and faggot, and all rabid cruelty and unheard of inhumanity; and in that alſo, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> corrupteth, yea annihilateth all the offices of Jeſus Chriſt, retayning onely his name, but adulterating all true chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by conſequence deſtroying the very humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt, making it preſent in many places at one and the ſame time, and yet not viſible, a body and no body. I ſay in all theſe reſpects, a man may without any wrong done to the Church of Rome conclude that ſhee is no true Church, nor the ground and pillar of Truth. But to the end Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that neither you, or any other may think, I do too highly prayſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the purity of her Doctrine and worſhip, and honouring of Chriſt, or calumniate the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when I charge her with all theſe things, of adulterating all the true Chriſtian Religion and annihilating all the offices of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. I thought it very neceſſary here to parallell the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> together, that it may the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appeare unto all men under one view as it were in a Table, which of the two Churches believeth beſt concerning Chriſt his natures and offices, and whether of theſe Religions is moſt ſound, and Orthodox touching all things neceſſary to be knowne and practiſed by all ſuch as deſire ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. And to begin with Chriſts Kingly office.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> believeth, that Jeſus Chriſt is the onely and ſole King and governour of the whole Univerſe, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. but more eſpecially of his Church, who by God himſelfe was ſet King over his holy mountaine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. v. 6. And that he is the King of Righteouſneſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. The King eternall, <hi>Jſa.</hi> 9. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. and that he doth by his mighty power and wiſdom
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:158688:48"/>uphold and governe all things, but with a more peculiar care, and in a more ſpeciall manner preſerve and defend his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. v. 10. as that which he hath purchaſed with his precious blood, and by his power redeemed out of the captivity and ſlavery of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and that he is the head of his Church, which is his body who infuſeth life into it, Righteouſneſſe, Peace, Joy, Happineſſe, and all the graces of Wiſdome and knowledge of God, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance of his love; and that his Kingdom and Empire is a ſpirituall and heavenly Kingdome, no terrene and fading Monarchy, <hi>John</hi> 18. verſ. 38. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. v. 33. And is uphold and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned onely by the ſcepter of his ſpirit and word, and not by the authority, virtue or wiſdome of any humane power. Shee alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, that they are the impious and blaſphemous inventions of frothy and windy ambition, to affirme that Chriſt appointed any one to be a Vicar and Governour under him, over his Church, who by an infallible and unerring ſpirit ſhould moderate and rule it to the end of the World: and to aſſert that <hi>Peter</hi> was this monarch and Vicar generall, and that the Pope is his ſucceſſor, the head, and foundation of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, all theſe aſſertions and blaſphemous titles the Church of <hi>England</hi> abominateth as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the honour and dignity of their Lord and King Jeſus Chriſt, and injurious and hurtfull to the ſalvation of mankind. Shee alſo believeth that the Church of Chriſt, which is his Spouſe is onely to be governed and ordered by Chriſt her head and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands command, Will, Word and Lawes, as they are ſet downe in his holy Word, and not by the decrees, determinations, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and traditions either of Councels or Fathers, no farther than they are conſonant to his Lawes and bleſſed Word, as they are written and ſet downe in the Bookes of the old and new Teſtament. Shee believeth alſo that the pure Preaching of the Goſpel, and the right adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments, and the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of God are the infallible enſignes of a true Church, and the never deceiving markes and notes of the ſame. Withall, ſhee believeth, that ſuch is the condition of the Church militant, that by reaſon of perſecutions and bloudy Tyranny, and the cruelty of the enemies of it, ſhe may be brought to ſo low a condition and be ſo obſcure, that ſhee may be without any viſible forme ſplendor and outward government, and lie hid not only from publike view, or the eyes of the common people, but even from the ſight of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:158688:48"/>the deareſt ſervants of God themſelves, as it hapned not onely in <hi>Elias</hi> his time, but in many ages beſides, as the holy Scripture abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declareth: and that the Church doth not alwaies come with obſervation, as our Saviour ſaid of the Kingdom of God in his time, that it came not with appearance and magnificence. And therefore the Church of England doth not believe that pompe, ſtate, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worldly dignity, and riches, miracles, multitude, and grandeur are the markes and notes of a true Church, but rather the very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the whore of Babylon, who ſitteth as Queen. And this is the beliefe of the Church of England concerning the Kingly Office of Chriſt and his Kingdome the Church.</p>
            <p>Now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> let us ſee what the Church of Rome believes concerning Chriſts Kingly Office and Kingdome, that both our tenents and beliefes being ſet downe together, it may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare which of our faiths is moſt orthodox, and which of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doth moſt glorifie and honour Chriſt their King and magnifie his Kingly dignity and abſolute ſoveraignty.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome doth in words acknowledge that Chriſt is the King of his Church, but in their workes and deeds they deny it: For they make him a terrene Monarch, and his Kingdome to be of this world, neither doe they admit and allow him to be the ſole, alone and onely King of his Church, but they joyne a Vicar with him, and divide the care of governing his Kingdome between him and his Vicar-generall the Pope, who they aſſert to be of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and un-erring ſpirit, and proclaime him to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the foundation and head of the Church, and Lord of all the Kingdomes of the earth, that he may diſpoſe of them as he pleaſeth, and give them to whom he luſteth, and take them from any that hath not a deſire to humour him, all which are titles of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and unſufferable indignity to the King of Saints, and King of Kings, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Church of Rome believeth and holdeth alſo that the Kingdome of Chriſt, which is his Church, ought to be governed not onely by the Lawes and Word of Chriſt, but by the determinations and decrees of Fathers, Councels, and Synods, and by the Popes Canons, and the vaine and impious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, which they doe not onely equalize but preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Scriptures. They alſo affirme that the markes and notes of Chriſts Kingdome are multitudes, ſucceſſion, miracles, pompe, ſtate, and magnificence, antiquity, unity, &amp;c. and that it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:158688:49"/>is, and alwaies hath been in a perſpicuous and glorious forme and viſible appearance: and the Church of Rome alſo affirmeth that the pure preaching of the Goſpell, the right adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and the true invocation of God are not the notes of a true Church, which is moſt impious to thinke. All this which I have now ſpoke, is the beliefe and faith of the Church of Rome concerning the Kingly Office of Chriſt, and his Kingdome the Church, as you well know Maſter <hi>Montague.</hi> Now I intreat you and all men a little to conſider, whether the faith of the Church of England, or the beliefe of the Church of Rome touching Chriſts Kingly Office and his Kingdome, be more orthodox, and which of them moſt honoureth Chriſt the King: And whether the Church of Rome doth any more but in word onely, acknowledge Chriſt to be King, and his Church to be his Kingdome, but in workes deny them; and whether the Church of England doth not both in word and deeds truely honour him for their King, and venerate his Church and Kingdome as his Spouſe. The Church of England gives unto Chriſt his due honour, prerogatives and priviledges, and all his glory and dignity, as their onely Law-giver, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power and abilities endeavour that his Soveraignty and Royalty may ſuffer no diminution, nor may in the leaſt thing be impeached or damnified: and therefore they doe believe, that the honour of governing and moderating of his Church is Chriſts pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar priviledge and right, and ſo annexed to his Crowne and Royalty, and ſo peculiarly belonging unto the Lord of life, as it is blaſphemy in any to aſſume that honour of governing upon themſelves, or any of his glorious titles, <hi>as that of Lord of Lords and foundation of the Church,</hi> which are his Prerogatives: and ſhe believes alſo that it is a great ſin and wickedneſſe in any Chriſtian to allow and approve of ſuch derogation from their King and maſter Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome on the contrary aſcribes and gives that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, and thoſe titles of dignity which belong unto Chriſt onely, and are his peculiar Prerogatives, unto a mortall Pope, Chriſt and his Kingdomes immortall enemy, and divides the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, his Kingdome, between Chriſt and the Pope: yea they doe aſcribe and give unto their Pope a greater power and authority than Chriſt aſſumed unto himſelfe, or that they give unto Chriſt. For their Pope may both diſpenſe with the Law of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:158688:49"/>God and Chriſt, and breake it when he pleaſeth, and decree againſt it, as you know very well Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> which Chriſt never did or aſſumed to himſelfe; and the Church of Rome in all things gives more honour and obedience to the Pope than to Chriſt: For, where Chriſt forbids, if the Pope commands, they will obey the Pope, and neglect Chriſts command, and make nothing of it: and where Chriſt commands and the Pope forbids, they liſten unto the Pope and obey him, and trample Chriſts command under their polluted feet. But for the more cleere evidencing of this truth, and that neither you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> nor any other may ſay I falſely charge the Church of Rome, conſider I pray theſe few following particulars, to omit many more. Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. ver. 25. condemneth all worldly Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and princely government in his Church, and in expreſſe words forbids his Apoſtles, and in them all their ſucceſſors to affect Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty one over another, or over the Church of God, in theſe words, <hi>The Kings of the Nations beare rule over them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> Contrary unto this command, or rather prohibition of Chriſt, the Church of Rome ſetteth up a moſt tyrannicall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monarchy and Dominion, ruling over both the ſoules, bodies, and eſtates of all ſorts, rankes, and degrees of men, and ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty as advanceth it ſelfe above all that is called God: and eſtabliſheth a government in Chriſts Kingdome, moſt like to the government of the Kings of the Nations, whereas Chriſt would have the government and rule of his Church moſt unlike to that kind of government: and therefore in this particular, it is manifeſt they preferre the Popes command before Chriſts the King of his Church. Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke to have eternall life.</hi> The Church of Rome on the contrary not onely takes away the Scriptures out of the hands of the people, but prohibits the ſearching and the reading of them, yea puniſheth the reading of them, or but the having of them in their houſes in the vulgar tongue with fire and fagot, and moſt blaſphemouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth them to be the cauſe of all errours, ſchiſmes and hereſies, and of all factions in Kingdomes and States. And in this point alſo you may ſee how they liſten more unto the Pope than unto Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. inſtructeth all Chriſtians how to pray, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are weary and heavy laden, &amp;c.</hi> The Church of Rome on the contrary, commands the people to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:158688:50"/>pray unto Saints and Angels, and ſends them on pilgrimages to their ſhrines, there of them to demand health in the time of their needs and neceſſities. In this particular in like manner they liſten more to the Pope, and ſleight Chriſts direction and command. Chriſt in the 24. of <hi>Matth.</hi> verſ. 26. ſaith, <hi>If they ſhall ſay unto you, that Chriſt is in the Deſert, goe not forth: behold, he is in the ſecret places, believe it not.</hi> The Church of Rome on the contrary teacheth and believeth that Chriſt is really preſent in all their Maſſes, and that he is there in the hands of their Prieſts, on their Altars, and in their Pixes, and where they pleaſe, and that they ought there to give him Divine worſhip, and puniſh the neglect of ſuch worſhip with fire and ſword, and the not believing of that doctrine, which is contrary unto Chriſts command, with moſt cruell deaths, and moſt exquiſite tortures. You ſee how in this point alſo the Church of Rome yeelds more obedience to the Popes command than Chriſts. The Lord Jeſus in the inſtitution of his holy Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. verſ. 27. <hi>tooke the Cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying, Drinke ye all of it.</hi> The ſame doctrine was taught by <hi>Paul,</hi> as received by Chriſt himſelfe, with a command that it ſhould be continued untill his comming, <hi>that all that were worthily prepared,</hi> ſhould take the cup as well as the bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Notwithſtanding this double com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt the King, the Church of Rome obeyes the Pope, and practices the contrary, and wholly takes away the cup from the people, and will not ſo much as let them touch it, much leſſe taſte of it: a moſt abominable ſacriledge, and intolerable diſobedience and rebellion. Innumerable more inſtances, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> might be produced, where Chriſt the King of his Church commandeth, and the Pope prohibits; and where Chriſt prohibits and forbids, and the Pope commands the contrary; and where the Church of Rome in all things obeyes the Pope, and diſobeyes Chriſt, by all which it may now eaſily appeare, whether of the two Churches, the Church of England, or the Church of Rome, is more orthodox in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and whether of them gives moſt honour to Chriſt. But let me intreat you Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> ingenuouſly to anſwer me, whether that Church that doth all that her Lord and King commandeth her, and declineth all hee forbids her, and gives her King all that due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and dignity that belongeth unto him, doth not honour Chriſt more than that Church that regardeth neither his commands nor prohibitions, but neglecteth them both, and trampleth all his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:158688:50"/>Lawes under her contaminated feet. I am moſt confident, Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> that upon your mature deliberation, you will grant unto the Church of England that preeminency, that ſhe is more obedient to Chriſt her King, and more honours his Kingly Office than the Church of Rome, and that Chriſt is King unto the Church of Rome in word onely, but in workes and deeds they neither regard either what he commands or what he forbids.</p>
            <p>But now I come to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, concerning which, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I ſhall deſire you ſeriouſly to weigh and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the faith and beliefe of each Church concerning that, and which of them believeth moſt orthodoxly, and honoureth Chriſts Prieſtly Office moſt, whether the Church of Rome, or the Church of England. Upon triall, I believe it will appeare, in this point alſo that the Church of Rome maketh the Prieſthood of Chriſt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of nothing, howſoever in words they acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>The Church of England believeth that Chriſt Jeſus was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſealed by God himſelfe, to be the alone and onely mediator between God and man, and that he onely has compleated, and in all things fulfilled the whole Law of God, and ſatisfied his juſtice and wrath by paying the ranſome due for our tranſgreſſions, when he offered himſelfe a ſacrifice propitiatory upon the croſſe for our ſins. She believeth alſo that Chriſt alone doth now make requeſt for us with God, in whoſe Name all the faithful with confidence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have continually acceſſe unto the Throne of grace, with full aſſurance to be heard. She believeth likewiſe that Chriſt alone is Mediator both of redemption and interceſſion: and that we are not to put up our petitions and ſupplications either to Saints or Angels, as being a thing derogatory to the dignity and glory of our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and a meere robbing him of his due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. She believeth in like manner, that Chriſt is the onely Prieſt of the new Teſtament, and that there are no other reall Prieſts on earth appointed by God to offer up Chriſt daily to God the Father, a propitiatory Sacrifice for the living and for the dead, and that it is blaſphemy againſt the eternall Prieſthood of Chriſt, ſo to affirme. She believeth alſo, that the Sacrifice of Chriſt being of an infinite vertue and efficacy, is to be applied to all believers, by ſuch meanes onely as God himſelfe hath appointed, as by the vertue and power of the holy Ghoſt and faith, by the preaching of the Goſpell and the right adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments and Prayer, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:158688:51"/>that this Sacrifice offered upon the croſſe, was moſt perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and ought not to be reiterated and renewed by any man upon the earth, and that the reiteration of it is both derogatory to the al-ſufficiency of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and pernicious to the ſoules of men, and indeed a meere blaſphemy. She believeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we being cloathed with the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt our high Prieſt and Mediator, and appearing before God in it, that we are freed by vertue of that, both from the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all our ſinnes, and are accounted righteous before God. She believeth alſo that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that onely, purgeth us from all our ſinnes, and that there is no other Purgatory by which the ſoules of men are purified and cleanſed from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities and pollutions: and that there is no man living, that can either by doing or ſuffering ſatisfie the juſtice of God, much leſſe merit or doe workes of ſupererogation: and that the preachers of the Goſpell have onely power delegative, miniſteriall and conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to forgive ſinnes, as Ambaſſadours, and not as abſolute Judges: and that this Office is peculiar to God and Chriſt alone as our high Prieſt and Mediator of the everlaſting covenant. And this is the faith of the Church of England, concerning Chriſts Prieſtly Office.</p>
            <p>The beliefe of the Church of Rome is this, that Chriſt is the Mediator of ſatisfaction and redemption, but they aſſigne the other part of his mediation and interceſſion to Saints and Angels, and the prime place of that imployment they give unto the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who they call the Queen of Heaven, and the doore of Paradiſe, and they put up their prayers and requeſts to her and other Saints and Angels, hoping to be heard: which is nothing elſe but to allow Chriſt a momentany or temporary and partiall mediation, and to give unto the Saints and Angels that everlaſting and never dying interceſſion, then the which there cannot be a greater contumely and indignity offered to the eternall Prieſt our Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, it taking away ſo great a portion of honour from him; and to ſpeake in plaine Engliſh, it is an unſufferable blaſphemy. The Church of Rome appointeth other Prieſts alſo, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> to offer up Chriſt himſelfe daily (as they ſay) to God the father a propitiatory Sacrifice for the living and the dead, which is nothing elſe but blaſphemouſly to inſimulate and accuſe Chriſts Sacrifice of imperfection. The Church of Rome alſo aſſerteth and believeth that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt our Mediator is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:158688:51"/>unto us: and affirmes, that by Chriſts merits and paſſion we are onely freed from the guilt of our ſinnes, but not from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them, &amp; that we our ſelves muſt ſatisfie the puniſhment. She believeth alſo, that we are able in this life, if we will our ſelves, not onely to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, and keepe the Law, but alſo to merit and doe workes of ſupererogation. She farther believeth, that if any man depart out of this life before he hath fully ſatisfied God for his ſinnes, that then he is to remaine in a place called Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, there to be tormented and purged from all his pollutions and defilements, &amp; that there is no entrance into Heaven or redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of that place, without an eſpeciall indulgence from the Pope, or innumerable Prayers and Maſſes for their ſoules, before they by torment are cleanſed from the remainder of all their ſins. She believeth alſo, that life eternall is of debt due unto us, as wages is to a hireling and daily labourer: and that their Prieſts can forgive ſinnes as Judges by their owne authority. This, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> you know is the doctrine and faith of the Church of Rome, and a great deale more ſuch ſtuffe. Now I intreat you, candidly to tell me, whether in your opinion the faith of the Church of Rome, or the beliefe of the Church of England concerning Chriſts Prieſtly Office be more orthodox, and which of them giveth moſt honour to their Mediator, ſhe that aſcribeth the whole worke of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to him alone, or ſhe that robbeth him of all his Prieſtly honour and Mediatorſhip? Truly, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> if you will but duely conſider this buſineſſe, and weigh it as it ought to be weighed, you will quickly perceive, that the Church of Rome doth in word onely acknowledge Chriſt to be a Prieſt and Mediator, but in deeds and workes overthrowes the right and power of his Prieſthood. And to ſpeake the verity, there can be nothing more blaſphemouſly thought, imagined, or practiſed againſt the honour and dignity of the Lord of life, the onely and ſole Mediator, and high Prieſt of the everlaſting covenant, then that the Church of Rome doth againſt him, robbing him of his due glory, and overthrowing indeed the whole worke of our redemption, making our ſelves and others our owne ſaviours and mediators, and not Chriſt alone, to whom all the honour and praiſe of our redemption of due belongeth. I could be very large, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> in aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating of the impiety and blaſphemies of the Church of Rome concerning this point, but I will ſay no more of it for the preſent,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:158688:52"/>but this, that it is a doctrine that overthroweth all Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and deſtroyeth the very foundation of our faith. And now I come to the Propheticall Office of Chriſt, where we will briefly take notice, whether the Church of England or the Church of Rome be moſt orthodox in their faith concerning Chriſts Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Office, and which of them more venerably believeth touching that, or giveth moſt honour to Chriſt the onely Prophet of his Church.</p>
            <p>The Church of England believeth that Jeſus Chriſt was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God himſelfe, to be the onely and ſole Prophet, Paſtor, and Teacher of his Church, and that he hath fully and perfectly revealed the whole counſell and will of God concerning the redemption of mankind, and preached the Goſpell and glad tidings of peace unto the World, the which Goſpell he doth daily vegetate and quicken in the ſoules of his people by his holy Spirit, and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and confirme by the holy Sacraments. And ſhe believeth that he hath delivered all things unto the Church, that God the Father commanded him, neceſſary for our ſalvation, and that we are <hi>onely to heare him in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto us, and that every ſoule that ſhall not heare that Prophet ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people, Deut.</hi> 18. v. 18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. v. 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. v. 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. v. 22, 23. And the Church of England believeth alſo, that Jeſus Chriſt did not onely declare and preach the whole and perfect Will of God unto the Church, but alſo that whatſoever was neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was written and penned by his appointment and direction, and eſpeciall aſſiſtance, and is all contained in the writings of the old and new Teſtament, and that not in obſcure and ambiguous words, but in plaine and evident expreſſions, as farre as is neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all which in the ſequell of this diſcourſe will be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. She alſo believeth that all the people ought according to Chriſts command read them, and that the holy Scriptures are the onely Judge of all controverſies, and have no need of any humane traditions. And ſhe farther believeth, that we are to ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God onely, as he hath appointed in his holy Word, and in the divine Scriptures, &amp; as Chriſt the Prophet of his Church hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in them: and that whatſoever doctrines not expreſſed and contained in the Scriptures and written Word, or grounded upon it, or evidently deduced from it, are not to be entertained, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or obeyed, but to be caſt out of the Church as abominable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:158688:52"/>things, ſuch as are prejudiciall not onely to our ſalvation and comfort, but injurious alſo and derogatory to the honour of our great Prophet Jeſus Chriſt, whom we are commanded only to heare and liſten unto. And therefore the Church of England doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all thoſe doctrins, of Will-worſhip, Image and Crucifix worſhip, Bead worſhip, Bread worſhip, Place worſhip, and all Saint and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell worſhip: and all thoſe doctrines of Service, Letanies, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and indulgencies, and thoſe of Faſt-daies and Feaſt-daies, all doctrines of Maſſes and Sacrifices for ſoules in Purgatory, and prayers for the dead, with all their doctrines of Pilgrimages and Monkery, with their doctrines of devils, prohibiting meats and marriage, and all thoſe doctrines of the reall and corporall preſence of Chriſt in their blaſphemous ſacrifices deſtructive to the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt, making it preſent in numberleſſe places at once, and enervating and overthrowing the al-ſufficiency of Chriſts ſacrifice. And all their doctrins of tranſubſtantiation, ſelf-merit, &amp; works of ſupererogation; and all the other doctrins they teach in the Church of Rome which would both endleſſe &amp; needleſſe to recount, the obſerving of the which is the onely imployment of the Church of Rome, the Church of England doth deteſt as execrable abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe our Prophet Chriſt Jeſus hath no where taught them in his holy word which muſt be the only rule of our faith and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the end of the world. But now let us heare what the Church of Rome believeth concerning the Propheticall office of Chriſt, that we may ſee how honourably ſhe eſteemeth of it.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome in word acknowledgeth, that Chriſt was by God appointed to be the Prophet of his Church, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in deeds they deny that Chriſt did reveale the whole will of God unto the Church in the holy Scriptures, and affirmes that the Scriptures were accidentally written, and not purpoſely to be the rule of faith, which by its clarity and brightneſſe ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the controverſies in Religion: they affirme alſo that the holy Scriptures are darke and obſcure, and very dangerous for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and therefore that they are to be taken from them; and that the Church hath need of the authority of Fathers and Councels, and the helpe of Traditions for the compleating of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the making of them a perfect and abſolute rule both of our faith and worſhip, whereupon they bring in all thoſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrins, and traditions, I even now made mention of, &amp; many
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:158688:53"/>more, and thruſt them upon the people as the worſhip and ſervice of God, and by the obſervation of the which they may merit Heaven, as they ſay, when nevertheleſſe, there is not one word in all the booke of God concerning any one of them, or any thing delivered by our Prophet Chriſt Jeſus touching them, all which things are as I ſaid before, not onely injurious and hurtfull to the ſoules of men, but full of blaſphemy and derogatory to the honour of Chriſt, our great and onely Prophet. For what, I pray, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> can be ſpoke more impiouſly of the holy Scripturs then to affirm, they were accidentally written, and not of ſet purpoſe, and by the command of God, and to the end that they ſhould be the rule of faith, when in the holy Scripture it is evidently cleare, that they were written by divine providence for this very end and purpoſe, that by them we ſhould order both our faith, lives and manners. And what can be ſpoke more contumeliouſly againſt the holy Word of God, then to accuſe it of obſcurity and darkneſſe, when the Holy Ghoſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the contrary? and to take it out of the hands of the people, and forbid them to read it, when notwithſtanding Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in expreſſe words? Truely, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> theſe are moſt blaſphemous aſſertions, and ſuch as you of the Church of Rome muſt earneſtly and ſeriouſly repent of, if ever you will finde favour at Gods hands, and the very naming of theſe your erronious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were enough for any man to abhorre them. But that you your ſelfe and all men may ſee the wickedneſſe of them, I ſhal before I paſſe on to the other matters in hand briefly prove that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were not accidentally written, but of ſet purpoſe, and by Gods appointment; and that they are not obſcure and darke in things pertaining to ſalvation, and that they ought to be read by all the people, and that they ought to examine all doctrines by them, as they be recorded. And then I will prove the al-ſufficiency of the holy Scripture, and that it is the rule which all men unto the end of the World are tied to for the regulating of their faith and manners, which is my taske, and then I will conclude. But firſt, as I ſaid, I will prove that the holy Scriptures were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally written, but of ſet purpoſe, and by ſpeciall command, and that they are not obſcure and darke in matters concerning ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that they are to be read to the people. And firſt that they were not accidentally written, I thus evince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe bookes that were written by Divine inſpiration, and by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:158688:53"/>of God, for the ſalvation of mankind and for the benefit of the Church of God in all ages, and for this very end, that men might learne, and know the mind and will of God fully and cleerly, and have the certaine truth of the things they had heard, that they might be preſerved and kept from all errors and upheld and comforted in every condition, they were not accidentally and occaſionally written, and out of the peculiar mation and pleaſure of the Penmen thereof, and by the will of man, but by the Spirit of God. But the holy Scriptures were written by Divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the counſell of God for the very ends ſpecified. Ergo, they were not accidentally and occaſionally written, and out of the peculiar mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure of the Pen-men thereof, and by the will of man, but by the Spirit of God.</hi> And for proofe of all theſe particulars the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe is clearly on our ſide, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> chap. 3. v. 16. <hi>The whole Scripture,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is given by divine inſpiration, or inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> Gods inſpiration is Gods <hi>dictate, and command,</hi> as all that know any thing in Divinity can tell you, if yee be ignorant, and it is as much as to ſay, they were written by Gods own appointment; for what God inſpires men to do, that he appoints and commands them to doe, ſo that it was not arbitrary in them to do it or not to do it, but they were inſpired to it, and put upon that imployment to write the holy Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Scriptures through the whole Bible are called the Voice of God and the mouth of the Lord, and the lively Oracles which were uttered and ſpoke by God himſelfe firſt, and afterwards delivered in writing unto the people by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and holy Pen-men, according to Gods command, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. v. 38. and therefore the Scriptures were not accidentally written and by the peculiar motion and pleaſure of men, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> moſt blaſphemouſly affirmeth. S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo is cleere in this point, his words are theſe in his ſecond Epiſtle chap. 1. verſ. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Wee have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto yee do well that yee take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, &amp;c. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this firſt, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Take notice firſt, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> of the occaſion of theſe words, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the expreſſions duly and you will eaſily from thence conclude that the Scripture was not accidentally written and by the will of man, but by command from God himſelfe and of ſet purpoſe, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:158688:54"/>that the written word is the rule wee are to be guided by, and more ſure then the Tradition of the very Apoſtles themſelves, although they were both eye and eare witneſſes of that they ſpake and told unto the people. For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in this Epiſtle, confirmes all thoſe Chriſtians that hee writes unto, of the truth and certainty of the things that hee declared unto them, ſaying that the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <hi>had not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when they made knowne unto them the power and coming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were Eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty; for hee received from God the Father, honour and glory, when there came ſuch a Voice unto him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved ſonne in whom I am well pleaſed. And this voice which came from Heaven wee heard, when wee were with him in the holy mount.</hi> Here wee ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> with <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as it is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. were both Eye and Eare witneſſes of Chriſts transfiguration and glory, and heard the voyce and the people by tradition and the relation of the Apoſtles that had ſeene thoſe things, admired and believed them, and yet the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in this very place, ſignifieth unto them, that the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God the holy Scriptures, the written Prophecies of the old Teſtament were a more ſure Word than any Tradition, yea even of the Apoſtles themſelves, though they were both eare and eye witneſſes of that they related and preached unto others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the people that they did take heed unto the written Word <hi>as a light that ſhineth in a darke place</hi> (no obſcure things then Mr. <hi>Montague:</hi>) and he giveth them a reaſon why the Prophecies of the Scripture were a more ſure Word than any traditions of men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith he, we know, that the Scriptures are not of any private interpretation, or from the peculiar or particular motions of men, or by the will of man: <hi>but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved</hi> by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is, we know and are moſt aſſured whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they declared either <hi>viva voce</hi> and by word, or whatſoever they ſpake by writing, for God ſpeakes unto his people by his Prophets both by voyce and writing, as is apparent through the whole Scripture, <hi>Iſaia</hi> 45.19. All that ſaith he we known was by Divine inſpiration, and by the counſaile, command and dictate of the holy Ghoſt, and therefore muſt be more ſure then all Traditions, becauſe they are Gods commands, and writ of purpoſe for the direction of the people and not accidentally; which will yet more cleerly appeare if we conſider ſome other places of holy writ, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:158688:54"/>Where <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorting the people if they would avoid all Gods curſes and procure his bleſſings and provide for their own eternall good and happineſſe, that they ſhould obey the voyce of the Lord, and doe all his Commandements, which are <hi>written in the booke of the Law,</hi> verſ. 10. Here firſt he ſetteth downe, what voyce of God they ſhould heare and what Commandements they ſhould yeeld obedience unto, and that was to the written voyce of God and the written Commandements, <hi>which are written, ſaith he, in the Booke of the Law,</hi> not to the Traditions of men, and affirmes that they were written for this purpoſe, that they might not run wandering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from place to place as men uncertaine, what was the will, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and commands of God, for they were written to this end that they might alwayes have them by them, and in their ſight for the guide and direction of their obedience both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Neighbour: <hi>for this Commandement,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which I command thee this day, is not hid from thee, neither is it farre off, it is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it us, and cauſe us to heare it, that we may do it? neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall goe over the Sea for us, and bring it us, and cauſe us to heare it, that we may doe it? But the Word is very neare unto thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart,</hi> for to do it, verſ. 11, 12, 13. It is written, ſaith he, and it was written to this end, that they might not be ſeduced by erronious opinions and carried about to the worſhipping of other Gods and ſerving of them: as this Chapter ſheweth and all the other holy Scriptures, and therefore was written not accidentally and by occaſion, but by Gods owne command and inſpiration. And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſame, verſ. 6.7. and in the fourth Ch. of the ſame Epiſtle, verſ. 21.22. ſhewing the end and reaſon why the holy Scriptures were written, he ſaith, <hi>it was not written for</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſake alone, that it was imputed, but for us alſo, &amp;c.</hi> for the comfort of all the ſonnes and daughters of <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſignifying unto all believers and the deare ſervants of God, that God had as great a care that they ſhould be taught aright how to pleaſe him, as <hi>Abaham</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the faithfull was, and withall, that he was the ſame God now he was then, not changeable for his ſervice and ſpirituall worſhip, but if that they would obey him and believe in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaggering and doubting as <hi>Abraham</hi> did and follow his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they ſhould be bleſſed with Father <hi>Abraham:</hi> and for this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:158688:55"/>very end, ſaith the Apoſtle, was the Scripture written by Gods owne appointment: and not accidentally. As in the 15 chapter and the fourth verſe. Where he declareth, <hi>whatſoever things were written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> In theſe words is ſet down both the reaſon and the end why they were penn'd, <hi>viz. That through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures we might have hope,</hi> that is, that wee might by them learne patience in all ſufferings, and be comforted in our greateſt calamities, in ſeeing and reading what God hath done to his ſuffering ſervants in all ages, and how hee was with them in all their tribulations, <hi>and was afflicted in all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and how the Angel, of his preſence ſaved them, and how in his love and in his piety he redeemed them, and bare them and carried them all their dayes. Iſa.</hi> 63. verſ. 9. The Saints, by ſeeing what God had done, and by reading how that he carried his people through and over all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and that his Angels have ever beene their guard, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is ſtill the ſame in all loving kindneſſe to them that feare him, they are comforted, and attaine to more hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, and for this end was the Scripture written by Gods appoyntment, and by the inſpiration of his holy Spirit, and not accidentally and by the will of men, but as they were moved by God himſelfe and received the Word from his mouth, as all the Prophets did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. verſ. 17. And in the tenth of the firſt of the <hi>Cor.</hi> verſ. 11. ſpeaking of the judgements of God that fell upon evill doers and wicked and ungodly men, and ſuch as provoke God by their ſinfull courſes, he ſaith; <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</hi> Here we ſee God had an end why they ſhould be written, which was upon counſell and deliberation in God himſelfe, <hi>for the admonition of his people,</hi> and for the inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and teaching of them to take heed of all evill courſes and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, if they would avoid his diſpleaſure and enjoy his favour and protection, and therefore the holy Scriptures now pend by Divine inſpiration and Heavenly command for this very end, and not by the will of man accidentally. Innumerable more proofes to this purpoſe might be produced, to prove that the Scriptures were not accidentally but of purpoſe written, for the good of all men, and for the preſerving of them from error, and that they might not be carried about with every wind of Doctrine, and the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:158688:55"/>vaine traditions of men and be led by uncertainties. But I will content my ſelfe with one proofe more and ſo conclude this my firſt argument to prove that the Scripture was not accidentally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and by the will of man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. verſ. 3.4. <hi>It ſeemed good to me alſo, ſaith S.</hi> Luke, <hi>having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the firſt, to write unto thee in order, moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou mayeſt know the certainty of thoſe things, wherein thou haſt beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</hi> Here are three things worthy of obſervation, the firſt that he had a perfect underſtanding and true information of the things he wrote, as having received them from eye-witneſſes, and ſuch as were without exception, being Chriſts Miniſters and ſuch as would not lie or relate untruths; the ſecond thing obſervable is, that he hath ſet down all the things, diſtinctly, plainly, and orderly, that there may be no difficulty in reading of them; the third thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable is, the reaſon why they were written and not left to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>thou maiſt know the certainty of thoſe things wherein thou haſt beene inſtructed.</hi> So that the Lord declares by theſe words that the Pen-men of the holy Scripture did not write accidentally and upon any ſlight occaſion, and of their own wills and peculiar motion, but that they were moved unto it by God himſelfe, and that all Scripture was given by Gods inſpiration and command, and for this end, <hi>that they may know the certainty of the things wherein they have beene inſtructed,</hi> which otherwiſe they could not have knowne, by reaſon of the great variety and difference that would have beene in them, if they had beene delivered by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for every one would have added and detracted, as had ſeemed beſt unto him, unto the ſtory, as we ſee it dayly in all matters and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences out of a mans owne ſight, and beholding with what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety theſe things many times are related, ſo that no man can tell the truth of them, till the eye-witneſſes or ſtanders by give the true relation of them by writing to the World, which men ordinarily uſe to believe, eſpecially if theſe men be of credit and reputation that pen them. So for the very ſame end, that the certainty of theſe things might bee knowne, that Chriſt both taught, did, and ſuffered for the Redemption of mankind, and for the good of the Church to the end of the World, the Lord moved holy men to both ſpeake and write what was ſpoke and written in the old and new Teſtament, for the learning of his people and the teaching of them, Patience, Comfort, Hope, Faith,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:158688:56"/>and all other graces, and that they might indeed have the certainty of his will and pleaſure what to cleave and ſtick to, and from which they may not be moved, though they ſhould be taught otherwiſe by an Angell from Heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. verſ. 8. And this I ſay was the end of the writing of the holy Word of God, and that by Gods inſpiration, dictate and command, and not accidentally, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> blaſphemouſly affirmeth for the enervating of the authority of the holy Scriptures, and indeed for the overthrowing of the honour and dignity of our great Prophet Chriſt Jeſus, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhould not be as faithful as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the houſe of God, if he had not commanded all things to be writ that he would have taught to his people, which is blaſphemy to thinke. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke for proofe of my firſt argument that the holy Scriptures were written by Divine inſpiration and Gods command and of ſet purpoſe, and not accidentally, and by the Will of men.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Argument is this. <hi>That which was written for the ſafety of the people, and for the preſerving of them in the true Religion, that was not accidentally written, or by the will of man, but by Gods appointment and of ſet purpoſe and for the good of all the Church: but the holy Scriptures were written for the ſafety of the people, and for the preſerving of them in the true Religion,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they were not accidentally written, or by the will of man, but by Gods appointment and of ſet purpoſe.</hi> For proofe of this, heare what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. verſ. 1. <hi>Finally my Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>rejoyce in the Lord. To write the ſame things to you, to mee indeed is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe: Beware of doggs, beware of evill workers, &amp;c.</hi> He had preached unto them and taught them the Truth former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and given them alſo caveats, to take heede of and beware of doggs, and of evill workers, that is, of falſe Teachers, but he did not thinke that ſufficent for their ſafety and for the preſerving of them in the Truth, unleſſe he did ſet downe in writing the ſum of what he had taught, and ſend it unto them, with a command alſo, that they ſhould walke and order their faith and manners, their lives, and converſations according to that they were inſtructed in by him, both in word and example, verſ. 16. <hi>Saying, let us walke by the ſame rule,</hi> I then gave you, and now in writing ſend unto you, and ſee yee ſwarve not from it and from our example, <hi>for it is ſafe for you ſo to do,</hi> and by that you ſhall be preſerved from the errors of falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But take notice, I pray, of the Apoſtles expreſſion, he doth not
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:158688:56"/>ſay only, that it was for their ſafety that he wrote unto them, but that it was for their ſafety that he wrote the ſame things hee had taught them before, to ſhew unto all men their weakeneſſe how ſoon they are ready to forget the things that are taught them of God, and how frayle they are and ready to be ſeduced from the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if they had not the Scripture to guide and direct them; and if the Chriſtians in the Apoſtles time had need of the written word for their ſafety, and that they might be preſerved from the errors of the times, and they were then tyed to be ruled and governed by them, how much more neede have we of the holy Scriptures now, when wee have not the holy Apoſtles amongſt us, and with how much care and diligence ought we conſtantly to reade and cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy Scriptures, ſeeing that they were by Gods appointment and inſpiration and not accidentally written for this very purpoſe that they might be a rule of direction to us for the preſerving of us in the true Religion? S. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 1. confirmeth the ſame truth in theſe words, verſ. 12. <hi>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you alwayes in remembrance of theſe things, though yee know them and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi> 13. <hi>Yea, I thinke it meete, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>Moreover, I will indeavour, that yee may be able after my deceaſe to have theſe things alwayes in remembrance.</hi> In theſe words, we may take notice of theſe particulars, firſt, that thoſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote unto were not ignorant people, but knowing and underſtanding people and ſuch as were grounded and eſtabliſhed in the Truth: the ſecond particular, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> nevertheleſſe thought it meete to ſtirre them up, and put them in remembrance whiles he lived, and that they might alſo be able after his deceaſe to have theſe things alwayes in remembrance, and that the Scriptures might be the everlaſting rule to all ſorts and degrees of people, yea the moſt learned and knowing men, and the moſt eſtabliſhed in the Truth have need of the Scriptures for their ſtill direction, and that not for a time but alwayes, and this was the end for which the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were pend and that by Gods own appointment, who inſpired the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and all the other Pen-men of the Sacred writ, and dictated unto them what they ſhould write, and all for the eſtabliſhing of the people more and more in the Truth, and that they might not be carried about with every winde of Doctrine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. v. 14. And therefore it doth of neceſſity follow, that the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:158688:57"/>Word of God was not accidentally written, or by the will of man, but by Gods appointment, and by his holy Spirit, and of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of my ſecond Argument. My third Argument is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That of which there was a neceſſity of writing, for the common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and for the encouragement of all Chriſtians, earneſtly to contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, that was not penned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally and occaſionally by the peculiar motion and will of man, but by the inſpiration and moving of the Holy Ghoſt, and of ſet purpoſe. But the ſacred Scriptures were written of neceſſity for the common ſalvation, and for the animating and encouragement of all Chriſtians, earneſtly to contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints. Ergo, they were not accidentally and occaſionally penned, and by the peculiar inſtigation of man, but by the inſpiration and moving of the Holy Ghoſt, and of ſet purpoſe.</hi> And for proofe of this, ſee what Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, ver. 3. <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common ſalvation: it was needfull for me to write unto you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you that you ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 2. v. 21. <hi>I have not written,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unto you, becauſe ye know not the truth: but becauſe ye know it, &amp;c.</hi> and in the 14, 15, 16. verſ. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which ye have heard from the beginning: if that which ye have heard from the beginning remaine in you, ye ſhall alſo continue in the Sonne, and in the Father. And that is the promiſe that he hath promiſed, even eternall life. Theſe things have I writ unto you concerning them that ſeduce you.</hi> Here the Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> writes unto knowing and underſtanding Chriſtians, and ſets before their eyes the examples of ſome that were fallen away and gone from them, to the end to make them more watchfull and diligent in taking heed unto themſelves, that they be not led away by the errour of the world, <hi>but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they were not of us, for then they would have continued with us: but they went out that they might be made manifeſt that they were not of us.</hi> And withall he forewarnes them of falſe Teachers, and gives them rules of direction in writing, and directs them to all ſorts of people, fathers, young men, and very little children, to the end they ſhould all read them, and have them continually by them, and obſerve them diligently, if they would be preſerved from all errours, according to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. verſ. 12. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:158688:57"/>fall;</hi> and that they might not fall away from the truth, he exhorts them in the place above cited <hi>to abide in the truth, which they had heard from the beginning, that was in the faith once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> and for their comfort he aſſureth them, if that truth they have heard from the beginning ſhall remaine in them, they ſhall alſo continue in the Sonne, and in the Father, that is, they ſhall have eternall life, and not onely be freed here from all the errours of the times, and of Antichriſt, but be everlaſtingly bleſſed, as the expreſſe words declare; and therefore he tieth them all to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word which was of purpoſe penned by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt, and by the appointment of God, and his peculiar mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not accidentally and by the will of man, and for this very end that they might not by vaine Traditions and erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any Antichriſts, be ſeduced and fall away, as others had done. And thus much ſhall ſerve to have ſpoke for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my third Argument. The fourth and laſt followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which God himſelfe writ with his owne hand, and that which was penned by ſpeciall command from himſelfe, for the ſalvation and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the whole Church, that was not accidentally and occaſionally written, and by the peculiar motion of the Pen-men, or by the will of man, but by the ſpeciall appointment of God, and by the inſpiration of his holy Spirit, and of ſet purpoſe: but the holy Scriptures were all of them either written by God himſelfe and with his owne hand, or by his ſpeciall command and appointment and by the inſpiration of his holy Spirit, and of ſet purpoſe, for the ſalvation and edification of the whole Church: Ergo, they were not accidentally or occaſionally written and by the peculiar motion of the Pen-men, or by the will of man.</hi> For proofe of all which, let us ſee what the holy Scripture ſaith of theſe things, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. ver. 18. <hi>Thus</hi> (when the Lord had made an end of communing with <hi>Moſes</hi> upon Mount Sinai) <hi>he gave him two Tables of the Teſtimony, Tables of Stone, written with the finger of God.</hi> And chap. 32. v. 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. v. 10. The Lord had ſpoke all theſe words out of the Mount, and there fully declared his will unto them, with thunderings, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as is at large deſcribed in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. yet ſuch was his infinite mercy and love to his people, and ſo gracious he was towards them, and ſo deſirous that they might not forget this Law, and by that fall into errour, and faile in their duty of thankfulneſſe and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, in their duty of love and charity towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as he recorded it, and writ it with his owne hand, that they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:158688:58"/>might have a more venerable eſteeme of it, and that not in Paper or Parchment, but in more durable materials, in two Tables of Stone diſtinctly and orderly ſet downe, to teach them that it was a perpetuall Law ever binding, and to continue to the end of the world. And when the Tables were by <hi>Moſes</hi> out of zeale broke, the Lord againe of his unſpeakeable goodneſſe commanded others to be made, <hi>and he wrote on the Tables according unto the firſt writing, the ten Commandements, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 10. v. 1, 2, 3, 4. Now that which was written by <hi>God himſelfe for the ſalvation of his people,</hi> and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of them from all errour, that was writ of ſet purpoſe, and not accidentally and occaſionally, and by the peculiar motion of man: as all men that have not abjured their reaſon will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. But that is not all, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that is to be taken notice of here, but we are to conſider likewiſe, that what the Lord writ in the two Tables, was ſufficient to the ſalvation of his people, if we had had no more written, ſo that none could have complained, that God had not revealed himſelfe fully unto them; for our Saviour Chriſt the Meſſias, of whom the woman in <hi>John</hi> 4. ver. 25. ſaid, <hi>that when he was come he would tell us all things,</hi> told the Ruler, <hi>asking him what he ſhould doe, that he might have eternall life, that if he would enter into life, he ſhould keepe the Commandements, Matth.</hi> 19. ver. 16, 17. if then the Commandements alone containe all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, as is evident by Gods owne teſtimony and by Chriſts witneſſe, how prodigiouſly blaſphemous are they that affirme that all the holy Scriptures containe not all things neceſſary to ſalvation? but of this point in his due place. For the preſent the place cited before proveth that the Scripture was not written acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, as the Church of Rome impiouſly aſſert. But now I will goe on to prove that the holy Word of God was penned by ſpeciall command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. v. 14. <hi>The Lord ſaid there unto Moſes, Write this for a remembrance in the booke, and rehearſe it to Joſua, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. ver. 27. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write thou theſe words, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>write this ſong for you, and teach it the children of Iſrael, and put in their mouths, &amp;c. Yea, the people were commanded to write the Commandements of the Lord upon the poſts of the houſes, and upon their gates, and to teach them diligently unto their children, and to talke of them to them, when they ſate in their houſes, and when they walked by the way, and at their lying downe, and at their riſing up, Deut.</hi> 6. ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. and the ſame reiterated againe <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:158688:58"/>v. 18, 19, 20, 21. So that the whole law was written by the command of God himſelfe, and was appointed by him to be the rule by which his people ſhould ſerve him, and by the keeping and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the which Law, they ſhould procure his favour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and enter into life eternall, if they could perfectly keepe and obſerve it, as is manifeſt by all the forementioned places: and in the 30. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> they are all tied to the written Law, as a compleat rule, and witten by God himſelfe, and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand penned by <hi>Moſes</hi> for that purpoſe, as a compleate rule. And therefore, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> how dangerous a thing is it in any to ſlight the holy Scriptures, and to vilifie them, and to deny them their due honour, and to accuſe them of imperfection, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre their owne Traditions before thoſe lively Oracles? Is not this, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> to deſpiſe the holy Scriptures? The Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap. 10. v. 28. faith, <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, under two or three witneſſes.</hi> What then will become of thoſe, that not onely deſpiſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his writings, but the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of all the holy Prophets, and bleſſed Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, and accuſe them all of imperfection, and obſcurity, and make them the cauſe of all errours, ſchiſmes, and hereſies, and of all confuſion, and that in the ſight of a thouſand witneſſes? Is not this enough to provoke the Lord who is a conſuming fire, to wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> as you love your ſalvation, take heed of ſuch expreſſions. I am the more large in this buſineſſe, becauſe you ſpoke very contumeliouſly of the Holy Scriptures, as all can remember that were preſent, as that they were accidentally writ, and not of purpoſe to be the rule of faith and manners, and not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule. But now to goe on, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 8. verſ. 1. had a ſpeciall command to write, <hi>Moreover, the Lord ſaid unto me, Take thee a great Roll, and write in it with a mans Pen, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 30 chapter and verſ. 8. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Goe write it before them, and note it in a Table, and write it in a booke, that it may be for time to come, and for ever and ever.</hi> And in <hi>Jerem</hi> 36. ver. 2. the Lord ſaith there, <hi>Take thee a Roll of a book and write therein all the words that I have ſpoken unto thee, againſt Iſrael and againſt Judah, and againſt all the Nations, from the day I ſpake unto thee, from the daies of Joſiah even unto this day.</hi> And <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 2. ver. 6. the Lord commands the Prophet ſaying, <hi>Write the viſion, and make it plaine upon Tables, that he may runne that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe had an expreſſe and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:158688:59"/>to write the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 19. <hi>Write the things,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>which thou haſt ſeene, and the things which are, and the things which ſhall be hereafter.</hi> And this Commandement of writing is reiterated ſeven times in the ſecond and third chapters of the ſame books. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of all that he had both writ and taught the people in the ſecond booke of <hi>Sam.</hi> chap. 23. ver. 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his Word was in my mouth.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of all the holy Prophets, Apoſtles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and of all the Penmen of holy Scripture, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 3. ver. 3. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, &amp;c.</hi> and that of <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 2. ver. 20, 21. <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, that no Propheſie of the Scripture, is of any private interpretation: for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie came not in old time, by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> I will conclude this point with that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 14. ver. 37, 38. <hi>If any man thinketh himſelfe to be a Prophet, or ſpirituall,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the things I write unto you, are the Commandements of the Lord. But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant ſtill.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, if any man will not acknowledge and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that I write nothing but what God hath given me in command to write, and which I pen by his ſpeciall inſpiration, and as he hath moved me, but will ſtill perſevere in his ignorance, and thinke that I write out of my owne particular and peculiar motion, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally and occaſionally, let him ſtill continue in his ignorance, I will not diſpute with him, nor bring any argument for the further convincing of him, <hi>but if any man will be ignorant, let him be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtill.</hi> So ſay I unto you, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if you will not, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all I have now ſaid, believe that the holy Scriptures were written by the ſpeciall command of God, and by his holy Spirit, and not occaſionally and accidentally (as you and the Church of Rome affirme) and by the will of man, then you may continue in your ignorance and be ignorant ſtill; but for the Church of England ſhe doth verily believe that the whole written Word was given by divine inſpiration, and by the ſpecial command of God, to the end that it ſhould be a rule of our faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that it is the very Word of God, and his lively Oracles, as having the teſtimony of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 24 <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>John</hi> 5. and many other places, and Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:158688:59"/>his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 3. v. 15, 16. confirmes the authenticality of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, and of all the holy Scriptures, and affirmes that they were written for the comfort and benefit of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and commands them to make them the rule and guide of their faith and manners which if they doe, he promiſeth them that they ſhall not be led away by the errour of the wicked, and from their owne ſtedfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>neſſe, but that they ſhall grow in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus, which is his prayer that they might do, and it is and ſhall be my earneſt prayer for you alſo, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that the Lord would open your eyes, and that you may ſee your errours and renounce them, and at laſt believe that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are Gods very Word, and were writ by his ſpeciall command, and are to be the rule of our fath and manners, and by the which we ſhall be judged at the laſt day. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke concerning this point.</p>
            <p>Now I come to prove that the holy Scriptures are not obſcure and darke, but cleare and perſpicuous in all things that concerne ſalvation. <hi>David</hi> in the 19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ver. 7, 8. <hi>The Law of the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is perfect, converting the ſoule, The teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wiſe the ſimple. The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart, the Commandement of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> Here are two things, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> confirmed by <hi>David,</hi> who wrote by the Spirit of God, which cannot erre; the firſt is, that the Law of the Lord is perfect and converting the ſoule, and making wiſe the ſimple: the ſecond, that it is cleare illuminating the eyes. What Blaſphemy then is it in the Church of Rome, to accuſe the whole Scripture, not onely of imperfection, but of darkneſſe and obſcurity? Yea, what elſe is it but to give the Holy Ghoſt the lie, who ſaith, that the holy Scripture is not onely perfect, but <hi>illuminating, and enlightning the eyes?</hi> And in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119. v. 103. <hi>Thy Word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a Lampe unto my feet, and a light to my waies.</hi> And in the 130 verſe, <hi>The entrance of thy Word,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>giveth light, it giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> So that there are none, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> that will not turne their backe upon this Lampe, but may ſee the light of it. And in <hi>Proverb.</hi> 1. ver. 2, 3, 4, 5. among the praiſes of the holy Word he ſaith, <hi>That it giveth ſubtilty to the ſimple, and to the young man knowledge and diſcretion.</hi> And in the 6. chap. ver. 23. he ſaith, <hi>That the Commandement is a Lampe, and the Law is light.</hi> And in chap. 8. ver. 8, 9. <hi>All the words of my mouth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are in righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:158688:60"/>they are all plaine to him that underſtandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</hi> Infinite places to this purpoſe might be cited, but I will content my ſelfe onely with two more out of the New Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. v. 3, 4. <hi>If our Goſpell,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: to whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine into them.</hi> Take notice, Mr. <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> that as the Sunne, though it ſhineth forth never ſo gloriouſly, and in all its greateſt brightneſſe, yet the blind ſee never the more; in like manner, though the holy Scripture be never ſo cleare and perſpicuous in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, yet the unbelievers and incredulous, whoſe eyes the God of this world hath blinded, they can neither ſee nor comprehend the light of them. St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 1. v. 19. <hi>We have alſo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a more ſure word of Propheſie, whereunto you doe well that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a darke place, untill the day dawne and the Day-ſtarre ariſe in your hearts.</hi> If the holy Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> compares the writings of the Old Teſtament to a light, and the Scripture of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Day-ſtarre, what wickedneſſe then is it, Mr. <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> in the Church of Rome to accuſe all the holy Scriptures of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and darkneſſe, and to make them the cauſe of all errours and hereſies, and of all confuſions?</p>
            <p>I will now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> briefly prove that the people ought to read the holy Scriptures, and that it is their duty to ſtudy them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and that it is a great and inſufferable injury and wrong done to them by the Church of Rome to take the Scriptures out of their hands, and to prohibite the reading of them, for in that, they like the Scribes, Phariſees, and Lawyers, take away from them the Key of knowledge, and the meanes of their ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. v. 52. contrary to the command of God, and Chriſts precept, who was the onely Prophet of his Church, whom we are bound to heare and obey in all things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. This, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I will firſt doe, and then come to the point. The Lord, after that he had proclaimed his Law unto the people, and writ it with his owne hand, commanded all the people carefully to obſerve, to doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he had taught them, and that they might the better remember it, he enjoynes them to keepe it in their hearts, and to write it upon the Poſts of their houſes, and on their gates: the words are theſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, <hi>All theſe words which I command
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:158688:60"/>thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talke of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up. And thou ſhalt bind them for a ſigne upon thy hand, and they ſhall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou ſhalt write them upon the poſts of thine houſe, and on the gates.</hi> And in the 11. chapter of the ſame booke he reiterates the ſame command, verſ. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhall ye lay up theſe my words in your heart, and in your ſoule, and bind them for a ſigne upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye ſhall teach them your children, ſpeaking of them, when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, when thou lieſt downe, and when thou riſeſt up, and thou ſhalt write them upon the doore poſts of thine houſe, and upon thy gates.</hi> Here is precept upon precept, as if the Lord could never have ſpoke enough unto the people, to ſtir them up to the diligent learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtudying of his holy Lawes, and all for their owne good, <hi>that their daies might be multiplied, and the daies of their children, as the daies of Heaven upon the earth,</hi> verſ. 21. So that it had been a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious thing in Iſrael, to forbid the people the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings and books, when God commanded all the people, without exception, to write his Laws upon the poſts of their doores, and upon their gates, to the end that all men of what ranke or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever they were, might read them, and ſquare their lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, and yet the Church of Rome contrary unto Gods command forbids the people either to read, or have the Scripture in their houſes. And in the 34. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>Seeke ye out of the booke of the Lord, and read, &amp;c.</hi> The Prophet here addreſſeth his ſpeech to all the people of the earth, as is evident by the beginning of the chapter. And in <hi>Malachi</hi> 4. verſ. 4. <hi>Remember ye,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the Law of Moſes my ſervant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb, for all Iſrael, with the Statutes and judgements.</hi> Here likewiſe all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are commanded and enjoyned to the reading and remembring of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. Yea Kings themſelves and Governours are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to read the Law, and to governe themſelves, and the people committed to their charge, according to the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. ver. 18, 19. <hi>And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that he ſhall write him a copy of this Law in a booke, out of that which is before the Prieſts, and the Levites. And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the daies of his life: that he may learne to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:158688:61"/>feare the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of his Law, and theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to doe them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turne not aſide from the Commandement to the right hand or to the left: to the end he may prolong his dayes in his Kingdome; hee and his children in the middeſt of Jſrael.</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re we ſee the Kings themſelves are as ſtrictly commanded to keepe the Law of God, as the meaneſt of the people. And <hi>Joſua</hi> 1. v. 7, 8. <hi>Only be thou ſtrong and very coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: that thou mayeſt obſerve to doe according to all the Law, which</hi> Moſes <hi>my ſervant commanded thee: turne not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayeſt proſper whitherſoever thou go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt. This book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhall have good ſucceſſe. Joſua</hi> was the Generall of their Army, and yet hee is by an expreſſe command injoyned to reade, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in the holy Scriptures night and day, and commanded not to turne to the right hand or to the left, but to order his life and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the people according to the ſame, all the dayes of his life. And <hi>Joſua</hi> in the 23 Chap. verſ. 6. exhorts the people ſaying, <hi>Be ye of a valiant courrage to obſerve, and do all that is written in the book of the law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>that ye turne not there-from, to the right hand or to the left.</hi> He ties all the people to the written Law, and commands univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and conſtant obedience unto it, and promiſeth them bleſſings from God if they ſhal obey, and pronounceth judgements from God againſt them, if they ſhall rebell and be diſobedient; and for the more animating of them to the duty of obedience, he ſets his own example before them, Chap. 24. v. 15. with his reſolution, that hee and his <hi>houſe would ſerve the Lord,</hi> if others would not, and by that, he teacheth every one their duty, that if all the world would go from God, yet every one of us is particularly bound to cleave unto him, and the way to cleave unto the Lord, is, to follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Law, and continually to have it before our eyes and in our hearts, according to <hi>Solomons</hi> counſell frequently ſet down. <hi>My ſonne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. verſ. 1. <hi>Forget not my Law, but let thy heart keepe my Commandements: for length of dayes and yeares of life, and peace ſhall they adde unto thee. Let not mercy and truth forſake thee: binde them about thy necke, write them upon the Table of thy heart. So ſhalt thou finde favour, and good underſtanding in the ſight of God and man. Solomon</hi> contents not himſelfe only to teach all men their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

When thou goeſt, it ſhall leade thee; when thou ſleepeſt, it ſhall keepe thee; and when thou awakeſt, it ſhall talke with thee; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is a Lampe, and the Law is light, and reproofes of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are the way of life.</hi> Infinite places more might be alledged out of all the holy Scriptures of the old Teſtament, where all the holy Prophets exhort the people to the ſtudying, meditating, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, and where they pronounce them bleſſed that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and meditate in the Law night and day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.

Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I ſhall now intreate you a little to conſider with your ſelfe, and examine, how the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> obeyes theſe-precepts and commands of God and of the great Prophet, and of the bleſſed Apoſtle, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no by her diſobedience and Rebellion ſhee deſervedly hath not loſt the Title of a true Church, which by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> firſt of <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>is called the ground and Pillar of truth,</hi> in that every true Church putteth not the Candle and light of the Word under a Buſhell, but ſetteth it up and holdeth it forth, maintaines and defendeth it, and offereth it to the view and hearing of every one. But doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this Mr. <hi>Montague?</hi> Nay, doth ſhee not take the Word of God, the everlaſting Goſpell out of the hands of the people and deprive them of that Key of knowledge, and puniſh the reading of it with ſevereſt cruelty, and the but having of it in their houſes in the vulgar Tongue, with the Inquiſition and death? Chriſt our Prophet ſayth, <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Teacher of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſayth, <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi> And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prohibiteth the reading of the Scripture, and is ſo farre from letting the Word of God dwell in the hearts of the people, that ſhee will not permit them to have it in their houſes. How then is ſhe I pray you the ground and pillar of Truth, when ſhee is the mother of error and confuſion? for our Saviour in the 22 of <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, <hi>Yee erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> That Church then, that taketh away the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the People, is no true Church, but an erroneous and falſe Church. Conſider I pray, what I ſay, and ſuffer not your ſelfe to be deluded. But I will go on a little farther, to ſhew the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and ſacrilegious dealing of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point, and how farre ſhee is gone from both the precepts of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of all the holy Apoſtles, and from the example and practice of all the Primitive Chriſtians, whoſe examples in all well-doing wee are bound to follow: Chriſt in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. verſ. 28. ſayth, <hi>Bleſſed are they which heare the Word of God and keepe it.</hi> If they be bleſſed that heare the Word of God and keepe it; then they alſo are no leſſe bleſſed, that reade the Word of God and keepe it.

What thinke you Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> of this buſineſſe? Tell mee ingenuouſly the next time I ſee you, what you thinke of your father the Pope, whether hee be not as honeſt a Genleman as ever went over a houſe. Now I pray looke upon the practice of the primitive Chriſtians, it is ſaid of that noble Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. verſ. 27.28. to his eternall prayſe, that <hi>came to Jeruſalem to worſhip, that as hee returned ſitting in his Chariot hee read</hi> Eſaias <hi>the Prophet.</hi> Without doubt if hee read him before he was a Chriſtian, he read him much more and more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently after hee was a Chriſtian: and if hee read the Prophets before hee underſtood them, it is very like that he was a more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader of them, when he underſtood them; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> this was no Church-man, that I may ſpeake in your dialect, but a ſecular Lord, the Treaſurer of the Queene of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> It was his greateſt honour that he was a reader of the holy Scripture, and in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is an infamy and hainous crime that is expiated with death, for any ſecular men to reade the Prophecies and Scriptures, or to have them in their houſes. What thinke you I pray Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> of this dealing of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> towards her ſonnes and children? Is ſhee not a very cruell ſtep-mother, that thus murthereth her poore childrens ſoules and bodies, that ſnatcheth the Paps and Breaſts by which they ſhould be nouriſhed out of, their mouthes, and keepes away the Milke of the word from them? It is ſaid of the <hi>Bereans, Act.</hi> 17. verſ. 11. to their everlaſting honour, that <hi>they were more noble than they which were at Theſſalonica,</hi> and wherefore were they more honorable? becauſe ſaith S. <hi>Luke, they received the Word with all readineſs, ſearching the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:158688:63"/>Scriptures dayly, whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> And this was a thing very laudable in them, and left for our imitation, and to be a Leſſon for all men, that they ſhould examine whatſoever is taught them, and by whomſoever, by the holy Scripture, which to do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would be puniſhed with all ſeverity as you know very well Mr. <hi>Montague.</hi> It was <hi>Timothies</hi> praiſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. v. 15. <hi>That he knew the Scriptures from his child-hood,</hi> and that in thoſe tender yeares hee read the Word of God. Here we have the example of a youth to his ever honour, who was acquainted with the holy Scriptures, and the very reading of them would be puniſhed in old men in Italy or under the Popes Dominions. What a deſperate height of ſacrilegious wickedneſſe is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to, that dares againſt the command of God, and againſt all juſtice and honeſty take the Word of God and the holy Scriptures out of the hands of the people, for whoſe cauſe principally they were writ? For the Apoſtles writ moſt of their Epiſtles not to the Presbyters and Biſhops, but to the Churches in generall. <hi>To the Churches of God, to the ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt, and to all thoſe that call upon the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the 1.

And his ſecond Epiſtle is yet more generall, <hi>To them that have obtained like pretious faith with us, through the Righteouſneſſe of God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 1. What unjuſtice therefore is it Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to take theſe Epiſtles out of the hands of Chriſtians and Believers to whom they are ſent and dedicated? S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle and ſecond Chap. ſaith, that hee writes <hi>to Fathers, to young men, and to little children,</hi> to this end, to oblige and tie all people of what age, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or degree ſoever they be, to reade his Epiſtle. Hee writes his ſecond to an honorable Lady, who without doubt made no ſcruple to reade it in her Family. But in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the people to reade the holy Scriptures, or to heare them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:158688:64"/>read in the vulgar Tongue without eminent danger and ſevere puniſhment, if it be known. Although the Apoſtle in expreſſe &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall words hath commanded that his Epiſtles ſhould be read by all the people, as we may ſee in his Letters to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Cha. 4. v. 16. and to the <hi>Theſſalonians, When yee have read this Epiſtle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cauſe that it be read alſo in Laodicea, &amp;c.</hi> And in the firſt of <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. verſ. 27. <hi>I charge you by the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that this Epiſtle be read to all the holy Brethren.</hi> But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch a miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating age we live in, the holy Scriptures are ſnatcht and taken out of the hands of the people, and impious Legends and ſcurrilous Pamphlets are put into their hands. But to conclude this point, S. <hi>John</hi> in 1 <hi>Revelation,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>Bleſſed are they,</hi> ſaith, <hi>S.</hi> John, <hi>that reade, and they that heare the words of this Propheſy, and keepe thoſe things which are written therein.</hi> If the Spirit of God Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> calls and pronounces thoſe bleſſed, that read the Booke of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that is the difficulteſt of all the Scriptures, how much more bleſſed ought wee to thinke thoſe, that read the holy Goſpells and all the Epiſtles of the holy Apoſtles, and the other Scriptures, which containe many things in them, yea all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, very familiar and eaſy to be underſtood? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs muſt that people bee unhappy, yea curſed, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived not onely of ſo great felicity, but of all true comfort. By all this that I have now ſaid, to prove that the ſacred Scriptures were not accidentally written but by command, and that to be a rule of direction to all, and that they are not darke and obſcure, and that the people ought to reade them and ſtudy them all which our great Prophet the Lord Jeſus hath both taught and confirmed, and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles after him, whom <hi>he</hi> hath commanded us to hear, ſaying, <hi>He that heareth you heareth mee, and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and him that ſent mee, Luke</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. It is very evident that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth onely in word acknowledge Chriſt to bee the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church, but in workes overthrow all his offices and annihilate as much as in them lies the whole worke of our Redemption, and the whole worſhip of God, by bringing in a worſhip and ſervice of their own, which neither the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church, nor any of his bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles hath ever taught us. But it wil yet more cleerly be elucidated by that that inſueth, when I ſhal manifeſtly prove that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures containe all things neceſſary to ſalvation, &amp; that perſpicuouſly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:158688:64"/>and clearly; and that they are to be the only rule of our faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that all Chriſtians are tied onely to them to the end of the world, and that they are not to ſwarve in any thing from them, though an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach them otherwiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. both which the Church of Rome doth deny, and in that manifeſtly declare that ſhe maketh Chriſt a Prophet no farther than pleaſeth her ſelfe, when ſhe addeth her owne Councels, Fathers, Canons, and Traditions, and unwritten verities (as they call them) and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them not onely of equall authority with the written Word of God, but preferreth them farre before the holy Scriptures, when ſhe affirmeth that without them the Scriptures cannot be a compleat and perfect rule for the ordering of our faith, lives, and manners, which is not onely a point of high blaſphemy, but indeed an utter overthrowing of the Propheticall Office of Chriſt, as I ſaid before, and a bringing in of a new Religion. And now, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I am come to prove theſe two laſt points, <hi>viz.</hi> that the holy Scriptures containe all things neceſſary to ſalvation; and that they onely are to be the rule of our faith, lives, and manners, to the end of the world; and this, you know, was the taske I tooke upon me to make good, and had your promiſe, if I performed it, that you would be a Proteſtant. To begin therefore with the firſt, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures containe all things neceſſary and ſufficient to ſalvation; I thus prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, containes all things in it neceſſary and ſufficient to eternall life and happineſſe (or elſe we ſhould be wiſe but in part.) But the holy Scriptures are able to make us wiſe to ſalvation:</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. v. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Ergo, they containe all things neceſſary and ſufficient to eternall life and happineſſe.</hi> And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, we ought in matters of faith and religion, to content our ſelves onely with the holy Scriptures: which is manifeſt from the nature of the wiſdome and perfection the Scripture ſpeaketh of; for if the Scriptures be able to make us wiſe to ſalvation, and the very man of God perfect to every good worke, as after we ſhall ſee, what need then have we of unwritten Traditions? For the wiſdome that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of in this place, containes all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of knowledge in it, and comprehends all manner of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and divine Science that may make a man happy here, and bleſſed hereafter. What imperfection then, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> can any man charge the holy Scriptures with, when they are able to furniſh a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:158688:65"/>man with all accompliſhed abilities, ſufficiency and knowledge for living vertuouſly and piouſly here in this world, and for the ſaving of his ſoule eternally? for if the Scriptures of themſelves be of ſuch vertue and efficacy, the Spirit of God working with them, that in the matter of ſalvation, that great worke, they are able to bring men to perfection, yea happineſſ it ſelfe, and that eternall, then we ought onely to cleave unto them, and content our ſelves with their perfection, and not liſten unto the vaine and lying oracles of the Pope. But now to the words themſelves in order, which are the proofe of my Minor, with the occaſion of them, in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the which I ſhall alſo anſwer to your evaſions made at our diſputation. <hi>From a child,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy, thou haſt knowne the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> So that my minor is by this ſufficiently proved, and much more clearly it will appeare by and by: when we conſider both the occaſion of theſe words, and the other expreſſions of the Apoſtle in the following verſes, and what our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith of the holy Scriptures. The Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> in the verſe going before, which is the 14. ſaying, <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou hath learned and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them.</hi> In theſe words, the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him all Miniſters and Chriſtians to perſevere and continue in the things and doctrines taught by him: with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why both <hi>Timothy</hi> and all Miniſters and Chriſtians ſhould continue and remaine ſtedfaſt in that they had learned, <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of whom thou haſt learned them:</hi> for he had learned them of <hi>Paul</hi> the Doctor and Preacher of the Gentiles, that elect veſſell, that was by Chriſt himſelfe appointed to preach and carry his name among the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and who was guided in all that he taught and writ by the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. v. 37, 38. and who had preached unto them the whole counſell of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and confirmed whatſoever he taught them out of the holy Scriptures, by which he convinced his enemies, as all his Epiſtles and Sermons prove, and as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe witneſſed before <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. ver. 14. and chap. 28. and as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifies of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. ver. 23. ſaying, that <hi>Paul expounded and teſtified the Kingdome of God, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them concerning Jeſus, both out of the Law of Moſes, and out of the Prophets, from morning till evening. Paul</hi> in all his teaching, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he was guided by the unerring Spirit of God, confirmeth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:158688:65"/>all his doctrines and preaching by the holy Scriptures, which were written by his inſpiration, and therefore ever like it ſelfe: and with this manner of teaching was <hi>Timothy</hi> inſtructed, who having been not onely <hi>Pauls</hi> Scholler, <hi>but his owne ſonne in the faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. v. 2. for he had converted him by his preaching, proving every thing he had taught unto him out of the holy Scriptures: and therefore he exhorteth him to continue and perſevere in what he had learnt of him, and formerly been aſſured of, knowing that he proved all by the holy Scriptures, which thou, ſaith he, art very well verſt in, having known them from thy childhood: and by all this he proved the ſoundneſſe of his doctrine, that it was true and ſure, being grounded upon the written Scriptures, and had not onely them for a witneſſe of what he writ, but he appeales unto <hi>Timothy</hi> alſo to be his witneſſe in this behalfe; as if he ſhould have ſaid, Thou <hi>Timothy</hi> knoweſt well the Scriptures, and that I taught nothing but out of the Scriptures; thou art my ſcholler, yea my ſonne, and canſt ever witneſſe for me, that the doctrine that I have taught is of God, for it is agreeable in all things to the inſpiration of his holy Spirit as he hath declared himſelfe in the holy Scriptures, <hi>which are able to make thee and all men wiſe to ſalvation;</hi> and in this St. <hi>Paul</hi> is an example to all Miniſters to confirme all by Scripture, and this I thought fit to ſpeake of the occaſion of theſe words; and now I come to the more full handling of them, and by them to prove the truth of my Minor; after that I have given an anſwer to your cavill and evaſions, which was this, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place ſpake onely of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, becauſe ſaid you, <hi>Paul</hi> writes only of thoſe Scriptures which <hi>Timothy</hi> had learned from his youth, and they were onely the Scriptures of the old Teſtament that <hi>Timothy</hi> was inſtructed in. This, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> was your eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which if it be true, will notwithſtanding adde force and ſtrength unto my argument, as I then proved, and ſhall by and by more clearely and fully evince. But, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place joynes the Scriptures of the new Teſtament with thoſe of the old, is moſt manifeſt by the addition following, ſaying, <hi>Which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which words perſpicuouſly evince, that to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the old Teſtament, he joyneth likewiſe the doctrine of the Goſpell and the Scriptures of the new Teſtament. But you then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the doctrine of the new Teſtament was not at that time
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:158688:66"/>written and committed to Pen, but onely delivered <hi>viva voce,</hi> and received by Tradition. But all this you ſpake without either ground or any good reaſon, and againſt all light of right underſtanding. For it is well knowne, that this very Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was either the laſt, or one of the laſt Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ever writ, it being a little before his death, as appeares by the ſix and ſeventh verſes of the fourth chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand, I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith: hence forth there is laid up for me a Crowne of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me onely, but to all them that love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> So that it is evident, that moſt of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles were written before this time; neither will you deny Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> but his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written before this, and in that he had given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all the Miniſters of the Goſpell a perpetuall and ſufficient rule, how to order and governe the Church unto the worlds end; ſo that all men may perceive that the Apoſtle joynes the Scriptures of the new Teſtament with them of the old, when he addes <hi>through faith which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And for further evidence of this, conſider what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writes in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 3. ver. 15, 16. in theſe words, <hi>Even as our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved brother Paul, according unto the wiſdome given unto him, hath written unto you, as alſo in all his Epiſtles, ſpeaking in them of theſe things, &amp;c.</hi> This, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> as all men of ordinary wit, and all Hiſtorians acknowledge, was writ ſome good time and ſpace before this laſt Epiſtle, and a good time before his death, ſo that the Epiſtle that <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> his Countreymen, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> alſo at that time in their diſperſion writeth, and moſt of his other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, if not all, were written when <hi>Peter</hi> writ this Epiſtle, which by all probability, was long before Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his laſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſo that if you pleaſe to take an accurate account of the times, it will be evident, that all the Apoſtolicall writings, and the whole Scriptures of the New Teſtament, or almoſt all were then written when <hi>Paul</hi> writ his laſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> ſo that not onely the moſt of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, as <hi>Peter</hi> witneſſeth, but <hi>Peters</hi> firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle alſo were then written. So that your cavill, Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> and evaſion was but a demonſtration of the weakneſſe of your cauſe, and in nothing impeaches or enervates the dint and force of the argument, but rather addes ſtrength and vigour unto
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:158688:66"/>it: for if I ſhould grant you, which I cannot with any reaſon, that the holy Scriptures of the new Teſtament were not then written when <hi>Paul</hi> writ his laſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> it would be nothing to the purpoſe, or a matter of any moment, ſeeing that afterward all the doctrine of the new Teſtament was written and commended by the Pens of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts to future ages, and to this end, that they ſhould order their faith and regulate all their doctrines and manners according to them, with an eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. verſ. 6. <hi>That they ſhould not be wiſe above that which was written.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> alſo denouncing a fearefull woe and curſe to all thoſe that ſhall adde unto the holy Scriptures or detract from them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. ver. 18, 19. which all they doe, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that accuſe the holy Scriptures of imperfection, which is a great taking away from their perfection, and from the honour that belongeth unto them, and when they not onely joyne their owne Traditions to the holy Scriptures, but preferre them before them, which is not onely to be wiſe above that which is written, but prodigiouſly to adde unto the holy Scriptures, which makes you all liable to that curſe denounced by Saint <hi>John:</hi> So that if you, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> repent not of this ſo great a ſinne, <hi>The Lord will take away your part out of the booke of life, and out of the holy City, and from the things that are written in the Scriptures.</hi> But now, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I will make it evident that the argument will be of more force and more convince your erroneous opinion of the inſufficiency of the holy Scriptures, and prove the authority and al-ſufficiency of them, if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould there ſpeake onely of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, as you and your brethren would have him and not of the new alſo. And thus I prove it. <hi>If the Scriptures of the old Teſtament are able to make men wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, much more then are all the holy Scriptures both of the old and new joyned together, when thoſe of the new Teſtament fully and clearely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the old, and (with open face, the vaile being taken away) ſet forth Chriſt unto us; I ſay much more then are they being all joyned with the old Teſtament, able to make men wiſe to ſalvation: But the antecedent is true, ergo the conſequent.</hi> The truth is, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> they that ſay the holy Scriptures containe not all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, and that they are not, without the Traditions of men, able to make us wiſe to ſalvation, blaſpheme, and give the lie unto the Spirit of God, which affirmeth the contrary ſaying, <hi>that they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:158688:67"/>are able to make a man wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> And whoſoever, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> ſhall deny this golden ſentence of <hi>Paul, that all Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and profitable, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 26. to belong unto the the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, would be thought worthy not onely to be ſpewed out of the Schooles of all learned Divines, but indeed out of the number of all Chriſtians, and adjudged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for all godly mens ſociety. But that you may yet further be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that the Scriptures of the old Teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all things in them ſufficient for the ſalvation of the people of God under the Law, before the comming of Chriſt, I thus argue. <hi>That which was able to keepe men out of the place of the damned, and to bring them into the boſome of Abraham, and eternally to ſave them, that containes all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation: But Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, were able to keepe men out of the place of the damned, and to bring them into the boſome of Abraham, and eternally to ſave them: Ergo, the Scriptures of the old Teſtament contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all things in them neceſſary for the ſalvation of all thoſe that were under the Law, and the Jewes then had no need of any humane Traditions;</hi> and much leſſe have we having the Goſpell joyned unto the Law. But for proofe of my Minor, heare what Chriſt ſaies in the perſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if men deſire, to eſcape hell, and to be eternally ſaved, let them heare <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, ſaith Chriſt, let them believe and obey and doe what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets command them, and they ſhall never be damned; and I tell you more, ſaith Chriſt, if men will not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, no traditions will prevaile with ſuch men to move them to repentance, and turne them from their evill waies, no not miracles. <hi>For if they will not heare Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead, Luke</hi> 16. ver. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Therefore the Scriptures of the old Teſtament were not onely ſufficient to ſave thoſe that were under the Law, but they were tied onely unto them. But for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of the ſufficiency of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and that they contained all things in them neceſſary to the ſalvation of thoſe that were under the Law, I ſhall adde ſome other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proofes out of the holy Scriptures to evince it. Our bleſſed Saviour in the 5 of <hi>John</hi> ver. 32. <hi>Search the Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for in them ye thinke to have eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi> Here is an exhortation, yea a command, and that from the King of his Church, to ſearch the Scriptures, which were enough
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:158688:67"/>to put all Chriſtians upon that imployment, although he had given no reaſon of it, but laid downe his bare ſimple command onely, but he giveth them a reaſon of this his injunction, and that was from the emolument and benefit that would accrue unto themſelves by ſearching of the Scriptures, and that was life eternall: if you will ſearch the Scriptures, ſaith Chriſt, they will make you happy and ſave your ſoules, for they containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, and have eternall life in them; and that is manifeſt by two witneſſes, and you know, ſaith he, what the Law ſpeaketh, <hi>By the mouth of two or three witneſſes every thing ſhall be confirmed;</hi> Now, ſaith Chriſt, you your ſelves give witneſſe unto this truth, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have life eternall in them, and your witneſſe is true: and I joyne with you in your teſtimony, and I aſſert and witneſſe the ſame alſo, that they containe all things in them neceſſary to life eternall. Therefore, if you will not upon my command ſearch and ſtudy the holy Scriptures, yet if yee tender your owne eternall good, and the ſaving of your ſoules, which is better to you than the gaining of the whole world, then ſearch the ſcriptures: <hi>For in them ye have eternall life.</hi> But it will not be amiſſe a little more fully to conſider and weigh the words of our bleſſed Saviour: for as there is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable argument and a pregnant proofe in them to evince the al-ſufficiency of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament to thoſe that were under the Law, ſo there will from hence be deduced an infallible demonſtration for the confirming of the al-ſufficiency of the whole Scriptures, thoſe of the new Teſtament being joyned to thoſe of the old. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>for in them ye thinke to have eternall life, and they are they which teſtifie of me.</hi> In theſe words there is a twofold reaſon or a double argument to prove the al-ſufficiency of the Scripture of the old Teſtament, that they contained all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and in that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter engagement to the Jewes, and ſtronger motive to put them upon the diligent ſearching of them. The firſt is the teſtimony of the Jewes, their owne witneſſe, <hi>Yee your ſelves thinke in them</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>to have eternall life,</hi> that is, ye acknowledge and verily believe that they containe all things in them neceſſary to the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your ſoules, and your beliefe is good, and your witneſſe is true and according to the holy Scripture: for all errour and ſinne ariſe from the neſcience and ignorance of the Scriptures, <hi>Ye doe erre not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. ver. 29. Now errour and ſinne brings men to perdition and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:158688:68"/>eternall miſery, and by the knowledge of the Scriptures you come to the knowledge of God, and of his power, and what a juſt, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and holy God he is, and a conſuming fire, and how he hates all ſinne, iniquity and abomination, and by that ye learne to hate ſinne, ſhunne and avoyd it, and are taught all the right way of pleaſing him, and how to walke in his Commandements, Statutes, Ordinances, and Judgements, by which you ſhall ſave your ſoules and be eternally bleſſed: and becauſe you know not the Scriptures, you walke in the by-waies of ſinne and vanity, to your owne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ruine and perdition: according to that of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 29 of the <hi>Prov.</hi> v. 18. <hi>Where there is no viſion the people periſh: but he that keepeth the Law happy is he.</hi> Happy here, and eternally happy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, for ignorance of the Law is the cauſe of all miſeries here, and hereafter, but the knowledge and the keeping of the Law maketh them forever happy and ſaveth their ſoules. The ſame doctrine our Saviour taught, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. ver. 16, 17. the Ruler that came to him, demanding of him <hi>what he ſhould doe that he might have eternall life: If thou wilt enter into life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> For God had made that gracious promiſe unto his people of life upon their perfect obedience, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. v. 5. <hi>Ye ſhall therefore keepe my Statutes and my judgements,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>which if a man doe, he ſhall live in them: I am the Lord.</hi> And the ſame promiſe againe often renewed in many places, and amongſt others in the 20. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>And I gave them my Statutes, and ſhewed them my judgements, which if a man doe he ſhall even live in them.</hi> So that all the people of God, and the whole Nation of the Jewes were ſufficiently convinced of this truth, that the Scriptures contained all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, and this was their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and generall faith even in our Saviours time, though they were then much degenerated from their ancient purity in the ſervice and worſhip of God, and had brought in their owne Traditions, which our Saviour ſo often reproved them for, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and <hi>Marke</hi> 7. and by that alſo ſhewed the al-ſufficiency of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, for the Salvation of them that were under the Law, without any traditions of men: ſo that the witneſſe the Jewes gave of the ſufficiency of the Scriptures, that they <hi>had in them eternall life,</hi> was as a cloud of witneſſes, a whole Nation teſtifying the ſame thing, and Chriſt himſelfe approving of their evidence, and allowing of their teſtimony: and addes his owne witneſſe for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:158688:68"/>the confirming of the ſame doctrine, and backes it with an unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reaſon. You believe, ſaith he, that the Scriptures containe all things neceſſary to ſalvation, and in that you believe well, and rightly, for ſo they doe; I will give you alſo my reaſon of it, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument to prove the truth of your witneſſe, and of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Scriptures without traditions, and to move you to read them, <hi>for they teſtifie of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, for they ſpeak of me, &amp; preach me, and bring you to me, who am the Meſſias, the Saviour of the world, and they are the Schoole-maſter God hath appointed for that purpoſe to teach you to believe that I am he, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. ver. 4. for all the Law ſets me forth, all thoſe waſhings and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications of the Law, and all thoſe Ceremonies and Sacrifices have me for their end, they are but ſhadowes, and not the body, nor the truth it ſelfe; Yea, and the Morall law alſo, and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements that are the waies God would have you walke in, bring ye unto me, who am the doore of Heaven, the doore of the ſheepe, <hi>John</hi> 10. v. 9. <hi>Who am the way, the truth, and the life: and no man commeth unto the Father but by me.</hi> Now then when all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teſtifie of me, and teach you how ye may come unto me, where ye may finde reſt unto your ſoules, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>and bring ye to the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt, which is life eternall, John</hi> 17. v. 3. they containe all things neceſſary to ſalvation. So that, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> if there were no other argument in all the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but this very place in the 5. of St <hi>John</hi> for the proving of the al-ſufficiency of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament for the ſaving of thoſe that were under the Law, without any humane Traditions, this alone were ſufficient to prove it: <hi>For that which hath the teſtimony both of God and men, that it containeth all things in it neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is by the knowledge and faith, of which they might have eternall life, and be bleſſed for ever, that comprehendeth all things in it ſufficient for the attaining to life eternall, and for ſaving of mens ſoules: But the holy Scriptures of the old Teſtament have this teſtimony from God himſelfe, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and from the whole Nation of the Jewes, which is an Iliad and cloud of witneſſes, that they have life eternall in them, that is by the knowledge and faith of which they might have eternall life, and be bleſſed for ever. Ergo, they containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And if the Scriptures of the old Teſtament containe all things ſufficient to ſalvation, then the whole Scriptures, when they alſo of the new Teſtament are joyned unto them of the old, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:158688:69"/>be moſt abſolutely compleat, and have in them eternall life, and neede no Traditions of men for the perfecting of them and making of them an abſolute Rule, which is a high point of Blaſphemy to affirme. So that Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> hee that ſhall diſpute againſt the Al-ſufficiency of the Scriptures, ſhall diſpute againſt Chriſt himſelfe, and call the very witneſſe of God himſelfe into queſtion, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie. You will finde it a hard thing to kick againſt prickes as Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuting him, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. And this ſhall ſerve to have ſpoke concerning this place in S. <hi>John,</hi> for the proofe of the ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures under the Law. And I will prove it by other places alſo of the old Teſtament, before I come to thoſe of the new. <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 4. verſe 2. <hi>Yee ſhall not adde,</hi> ſaith <hi>the Lord, unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that you may keep the Commandements of the Lord your God which I command you. That to which nothing was to bee added, nor from which nothing was to be detracted or taken away, by the command of God himſelfe, that was abſolutely perfect: But to the written Word of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be added, nor nothing to be detracted or taken away, and that by Gods own Commandement:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the written Word and the Law of God was abſolutely perfect.</hi> For the Major Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> no man will as I ſuppoſe deny it, and for the Minor the place above cited proves it. <hi>David</hi> alſo in Pſal. 19. verſ. 77. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>converting the ſoule: the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple;</hi> from the which words I thus argue, <hi>That which is perfect in it ſelfe, converting ſoules, and giveth wiſdom unto the ſimple, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with all ſaving knowledge, that containes all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation, and is a perfect and abſolute Rule, and has no neede of humane Traditions for the making of it compleat. But the Law of the Lord is perfect in it ſelfe, converting ſoules, and giveth wiſdome unto the ſimple, and furniſheth them with all ſaving knowledge:</hi> Ergo, <hi>it containeth all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation, and is a perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Rule, and hath no need of humane Traditions for the making of it compleate.</hi> For the proof of my whole Syllogiſme, the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Text are ſufficient, I might here Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late proof upon proof out of the old Teſtament to evince the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, for the ſalvation of thoſe that were under the Law, without the helpe of any Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; but becauſe I have been very large in my former diſcourſe I ſhall produce no more out of the old Teſtament at this time: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:158688:69"/>let mee ſay thus much, that our Saviour and all the Apoſtles for the confirmation of the abſoluteneſſe and perfection of the holy Scriptures of the old Teſtament, comfirmed all their Doctrines of faith from them only, and ſend the people ever to the written word as a ſufficient and compleate rule of Direction. Yea, all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the old Teſtament likewiſe did the ſame, as wee ſee from <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. to <hi>Malachy</hi> the laſt Prophet, who in Chap. 4. v. 4. ſendeth all Iſrael to the Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo alſo the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the 8 Chap. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the people. And if we run through all the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets and the Pſalmes are the grounds of all their doctrines, and thither they ſend the people, upon whom the ends of the World are come, and tie us alwayes to the Scriptures of the old Teſtament and the writings of the Apoſtles under the new, with this expreſſe command, that we ſhould cleave onely to them, and not to be wiſe above that which is written, which ſheweth the abſolute perfection both of the old and new Teſtament, and that they neede no Traditions of men, for the making of them a compleat rule. And ſo now I returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the new Teſtament, and will from thence produce ſome more arguments for the proving of the Al-ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures in themſelves, and then conclude that point. And for the better proceeding in my diſcourſe I will goe on with the place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 Epiſt. to <hi>Timothy</hi> chap. 3. verſ. 15.16. where I began; <hi>All Scripture,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is given by inſpiration of God, and is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good workes;</hi> from the which words I thus argue. <hi>That which has all things in it ſufficient for the begetting of Faith and Repentance, and for the guiding, ordering and regulating of our obedience and manners, and for the ſupporting of us in every condition, that containes all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation. But the holy Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, have all things in them ſufficient for the begetting of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for the guiding, ordering and regulating of our obedience and manners, and for the ſupporting of us in every condition:</hi> Ergo, the holy Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation. For the Major, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> there is no man that either can or will deny it: for the Minor, it hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently by all the former diſcourſe bin proved, yet for the further
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:158688:70"/>confirmation of it, the very enumeration of the benefits that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto us by the holy Scriptures, ſet downe by the Apoſtle, in theſe words, that they are <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in Righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good workes,</hi> do abundantly prove it: <hi>for that which teacheth the truth, convinceth error, corrects vice, frames us to all virtue, and comforts us in every condition, and is able to make the very man of God accompliſhed and throughly furniſhed to all good workes, muſt needs containe all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation: but the holy Scriptures doth all this, as is apparent from this very place,</hi> and that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. verſ. 4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that were through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope,</hi> Ergo, <hi>the holy Scriptures containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> And by conſequence have no neede of any humane Traditions for the making of them a compleat rule. But for further illuſtration of this truth I will produce ſome other Teſtaimonies of the holy Scriptures of the new Teſtament. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. verſ. 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>For as much,</hi> ſaith <hi>S.</hi> Luke, <hi>as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order, a declaration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved among us. Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witneſſes and Miniſters of the Word: it ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of all things from the very firſt, to write unto thee in order, moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus: <hi>that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things wherein thou haſt beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> before I come to frame my argument out of theſe words, I ſhall deſire you well to conſider and to take notice of S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Teſtimony, which is this, that before hee wrote his Goſpell, many had ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things which were moſt ſurely believed among them, and ſuch men as were eye-witneſſes of the things they related and Miniſters of the Word, and therefore men without exception, and even theſe men had orderly declared and delivered in writing all things of which they were eye-witneſſes. So that by this, it is manifeſt, that a great part of the Scriptures of the new Teſtament were already pend, when S. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Goſpell, which was long before <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as all that are any thing verſt in the holy Scriptures &amp; in the hiſtory of thoſe times do very well know, contrary unto your aſſertion Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that the holy Scriptures and Doctrines of the new teſtament were not then pend, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:158688:70"/>
               <hi>viva voce</hi> and received by Tradition when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And now I come to my argument, which out of the words of S. <hi>Luke</hi> I thus frame, <hi>Thoſe writings that comprehend in them a perfect declaration of all things, that were moſt ſurely believed conterning Chriſts doings, preachings and ſufferings, and have in them a certaine and orderly narration of them all from the very firſt, and that ſet downe by them, that had a perfect underſtanding of them from the beginning as being Eye-witneſſes of them, and Miniſters of the Word, and were alſo pend to this very end, that the truth and certainty of thoſe things wherein they had been inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taught, might be knowne to all future ages, that all men might be kept from error and be eſtabliſhed and confirmed for ever in the truth: they containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation. But the Scriptures of the new Teſtament comprehend in them a perfect declaration of all things that were moſt ſurely believed concerning Chriſts both doings, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſufferings, the knowledge and believing of the which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſalvation, and have in them a certaine and orderly narration of them all, from the very firſt, and that ſet downe by them that had a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underſtanding of them from the beginning, as being Eye-witneſſes of them and Miniſters of the Word, and were alſo pend to this very end, that the Truth and certainty of thoſe things, wherein they had bin inſtructed and taught, might be known to all future Ages, that all men might be kept from error, and be eſtabliſhed and confirmed forever in the Truth:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the holy Scriptures containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> For the Major Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> I preſume you will not deny it: and for the Minor it is apparent from S. <hi>Lukes</hi> own words, and therfore theſe two conſectaries do from thence neceſſarily follow, the firſt, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures have no neede of any humane Traditions for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them a compleate rule; the ſecond is, that the Scripture is the certaine rule all Chriſtians are tied unto, to the end of the World, and that they are the onely meanes to informe us of the truth, &amp; certainty of all that Chriſt both did and ſpak, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and believing of the which conſiſts our Eternall happineſſe and ſalvation. And this Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> might ſuffice to have ſpoke to prove the al-ſufficiency of the Scriptures, without Traditions, but I will yet adde a few more arguments to eſtabliſh this Truth more fully, and ſo much the more willingly I do it, becauſe it is a point of ſo great concernment, and that about which there hath been and is the greateſt conteſtation betweene us true Catholicks, and you Papiſts. S. <hi>Luke</hi> affords us an other evident teſtimony to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:158688:71"/>prove the al-ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. verſ. 1. <hi>The former Treatiſe,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>have I made, O</hi> Theophilus, <hi>of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach, untill the day in which hee was taken up, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which words I thus argue. <hi>Thoſe Bookes and writings that containe in them all things that Jeſus Chriſt both did, taught and ſuffered for the redemption and ſalvation of mankind, by the knowledge and faith of the which men may be ſaved, they containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, and have no need of any humane Traditions to be joyned unto them for the making of them a perfect Rule. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the new Teſtament comprehend in them all things that Jeſus Chriſt both did, taught and ſuffered for the redemption and ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, by the knowledge and faith of which men may bee ſaved.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Scriptures containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> The evidence of the truth of this argument is ſo manifeſt that beſides <hi>Lukes</hi> owne Teſtimony, which is enough for ever to ſtop the mouth of all gaineſayers, the very Rhemiſts themſelves your owne wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes do acknowledge it, whoſe notes upon this place you may at your beſt leaſure looke on, their words are theſe. <hi>Not all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly (for the other Evangeliſts wrote divers things not touched by him) but all the principall and moſt neceſsary things.</hi> Theſe Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> are the expreſſions of your own men, in which obſerve theſe two conceſſions. The firſt, that they do acknowledge, that at that time that S. <hi>Luke</hi> writ his Goſpell; The other Evangeliſts had writ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things not touched by him. And this overthrowes your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> that the Scriptures of the new Teſtament were not then pend, but delivered only <hi>viva voce,</hi> and by Tradition, and this was long before that time, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Timothy.</hi> The ſecond thing that they grant (which is as much as I deſired) is this, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelfe had writ all the principall and moſt neceſſary things, ſo that if the principall and moſt neceſſary things to ſalvation were written by <hi>Luke</hi> alone, and the other things of leſſe neceſſity were written by the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, then by your owne witneſſes it followeth, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that all things neceſſary to ſalvation, are compriſed and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament compleatly and fully, and therefore they are abſolutely in themſelves perfect, and have no neede of any humane Traditions for the making of them an intire and perfect rule. And truly Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I dare at any
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:158688:71"/>time undertake this taske againſt all the Papiſts in the would, to prove, that if wee had nothing but the very writings of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> I meane the Goſpell written by him, and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, that there were enough pend for the ſalvation of men, and that there were no juſt cauſe of complayning of the in-ſufficiency of the Scripture; ſeeing that the knowledge and believing of thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and moſt neceſſary things are able to ſave our ſoules, as moſt certaine it is the knowing and believing of what hee writ is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſalvation. But when God of his infinite favour, and goodneſſe to mankinde, hath by ſo many of his bleſſed Servants, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, in ſo many ſeverall Goſpells and Epiſtles beſides the revelation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſo abundantly declared his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good will and pleaſure, it is not onely an intolerable ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in any, not to acknowledge it, but alſo an inſufferable blaſphemy to accuſe all the Scriptures of imperfection, yea, it is indeed an overthrowing of the Lord Chriſts propheticall office, and to give the Spirit of God and his holy Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts the lie, when they affirme the contrary ſaying in expreſſe words, that they have writ all things neceſſary to ſalvation: as by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies following will appeare. See what S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this buſineſſe of ſo great conſequence, Chap. 20. verſ. 30.31. <hi>And many other ſignes truly did Ieſus, in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Booke: But theſe are written that you might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of God, and that believing yee might have life through his Name:</hi> than the which, there cannot be a more pregnant proofe to ſhew the ſufficiency of what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſalvation. The argument from theſe words is this, <hi>That which teacheth and declareth unto us the ſoveraigne and chiefeſt good, and the meanes of attaining unto this good, that containes all things in it neceſsary to ſalvation: But the holy Scriptures doe teach and declare unto us the Soveraigne and chiefeſt good; to wit, life eternall, and the meanes of attaining this life eternall, to wit, faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Scriptures containe all things in them neceſsary to ſalvation.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> you have a minde to confute this Argument, you muſt then diſpute againſt the Goſpell of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> which confirmeth it. But heare, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> what he ſaith in his firſt Epiſtle, verſ. 1. &amp; 3.4. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which wee have heard, which wee have ſeene with our Eyes, which wee have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life. That which wee have ſeene and heard
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:158688:72"/>declare wee unto you, that yee may alſo have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe things write wee unto you that your joy may be full.</hi> The Argument from theſe words I thus frame. <hi>The holy Apoſtles did hear and ſee whatſoever was neceſſary to ſalvation: but the Apoſtles did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, ſet downe, pen and record in their writings whatſoever they thought uſefull, requiſite and ſufficient for the attaining of eternall life:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Apoſtles have declared and ſet down in their Bookes and writings whatſoever is neceſsary to ſalvation; and to affirme the contrary, is to give the Spirit of God and the holy Apoſtle the lie, who in expreſse tearms aſsert it.</hi> For the Minor, it is alſo manifeſt out of the ſame words. <hi>For that which unites us with the Father, and with his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and makes our joy compleat, that undeniably containes all things neceſsary to ſalvation: but the holy Scriptures unite us with the Father and with his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and make our joy compleate:</hi> Ergo, <hi>they containe all things neceſsary to ſalvation.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the 17 Chapter of his holy Goſpell, verſ. 3. has theſe words. <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Out of the which place I thus reaſon. <hi>That which teaches us the knowledge of the onely true God, and whom hee hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt which is life eternall, that containes all things in it neceſsary to ſalvation; but the holy Scriptures teach us the knowledge of the onely true God, and whom hee hath ſent Jeſus Chriſt, which is life eternall:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The holy Scriptures containe in them all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation.</hi> The Major is the Text, the Minor you dare not deny, but if you or any ſhall, it hath beene ſufficiently confirmed by the former diſcourſe. And theſe Arguments may ſatisfy any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature for the proofe of the ſufficiency of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without the additions of any humane Traditions for the making of them compleate; but by way of a corollary I ſhall yet adde a few proofes more, <hi>Heb.</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 1.2. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of that Epiſtle, <hi>Who at ſundry times and in diverſe manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> From the which words I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. <hi>If the Word of God neceſsary to the ſalvation of the Church, was firſt delivered by the Prophets, and afterwards by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Word of God delivered by the Prophets, is onely at this day to be ſought in the writings of the Prophets; then certainly, the Word of God delivered unto us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is at this day onely to be ſought
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:158688:72"/>in the writings of the Apoſtles, unleſse there can be ſome reaſon given of the diſſimilitude. But the antecedent is true,</hi> Ergo, <hi>The conſequent. Wherefore, the Word of God delivered unto us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles is at this day to be ſought, or found onely in the writings of the Apoſtles. And therefore the whole Word of God neceſſary to the ſalvation of the Church is contained, and at this day onely to be found in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and not in the vaine Traditions of men. The hypotheſis or hypotheticall connexion of this argument Mr.</hi> Montague <hi>is manifeſt by the very light of nature,</hi> quae dictat de iiſdem idem eſſe ſtatuendum. Now if yee looke into the ſubſtance of the word of God you will finde it to be the ſame both in the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, according to that of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 26. verſ. 22. Who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth there, that he ſaid, <hi>none other things than thoſe which the Prophets and</hi> Moſes <hi>did ſay ſhould come.</hi> And in Chap. 24. verſ. 14. he confeſt before <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour, <hi>that after the way they called</hi> Hereſie <hi>hee worſhipped the God of his Fathers, believing all things that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> So that for the ſubſtance of the word of God it is the ſame both in the old and new Teſtament: only the difference is this, that the exhibition or manifeſtation of the Word was far more glorious and perſpicuous in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than in the old, for there the truth was ſet forth under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſhadowes and repreſentations, but in the new it was cleerly without any Types and Figures declared unto the World; So that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his 2 Epiſtle to the <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 3. comparing them together in their glory, affirmes in expreſſe words, that the adminiſtration of the Goſpell was far more glorious than that of the old Teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calling the Miniſtration of the Law, Death, and the exhibition of the Goſpell, the Miniſtration of the Spirit, and the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſſe, and ſayes that it did exceede in glory, and in the 18 verſe, <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all with open face behold as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord;</hi> Whereas under the Law they beheld all things through Figures, and had alwayes a veil before their Eyes. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> in this point agrees with <hi>Paul,</hi> for he in his 2 Epiſtle, chap. 1. verſ. 19. compares the old Teſtament to a light or Candle ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a darke place, and the Goſpell unto the Day-ſtar. And there is a greater difference between the light, clarity and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the new Teſtament and that of the old, than betweene a little ſucking Candle and a great Cathedrall one, or betweene a ſmall ruſh Candle, or a little Lampe, and a mighty Torch: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:158688:73"/>a man by the help of a little ſlender light may be conducted through a darke place, and may by it be guided to keepe the right way, yet all men know, that a Torch or a great light will do that office farre more excellently; ſo although the law was a light ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the guiding of the people, and keeping them out of the by-waies of ſinne and errour, yet the Goſpell doth that office farre more illuſtriouſly, and there is as great a difference betweene them in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> judgement, as is betweene an ordinary light, and the Day-ſtarre, for they are his own words. All which things, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> makes greatly for the ſtrengthning of my argument, and the confirming of the truth in hand, and to prove, that if the Word of God neceſſary to the ſalvation of the Church, under the old Teſtament, was all to be found in the writings of the Prophets, much more is the Word of God ſufficient to ſalvation to be found in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts: which will yet more evidently appeare, if wee conſider and weigh the compariſon betweene the old Teſtament and the new, and the Word of God exhibited in them both. For if God ſpake by the Prophets in the old Teſtament, he ſpake alſo by the Apoſtles in the new. If the Prophets preached the Word of God, ſo did the Apoſtles. If the Prophets did commit the Word of God to writing, and penned it, ſo did the Apoſtles. And if the Prophets did comprehend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the whole doctrine of the old Teſtament in their writings, as they themſelves affirme, and as I have evidently in this diſcourſe, and ſufficiently proved, the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts have alſo compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole doctrine of the Goſpell in their writings, as they alſo teſtifie, and as I have abundantly ſhewed. And therefore with very good reaſon I may urge this place now in hand, and thus argue, <hi>If the Word of God which was delivered in divers manners and ſundry waies in time paſt, be notwithſtanding all of it to be found in the writings of the Prophets, then the Word of God, which under the Goſpell was not delivered in divers manners and ſundry waies, but after one way, is to be found in the writings of the Apoſtles.</hi> For otherwiſe, who ſees not but the force of the Apoſtles compariſon would fall to the ground? And if the opinion and doctrine of the Church of Rome be true, the Apoſtle ſhould ſay or conclude thus. As God ſpake in times paſt in divers manners and ſundry waies unto the Church under the old Teſtament: ſo now under the new Teſtament he hath ſpake unto us ſundry waies, <hi>viz.</hi> by the writings of the Apoſtles, by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:158688:73"/>their Traditions not written, and doth daily ſpeak unto us by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Injunctions, and Canons, by Councels and Fathers, and by the decrees of the Church: all which how contrary they are to the meaning and doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> every man can eaſily diſcerne. Yea the very Papiſts themſelves cannot deny it. And thus much I thought fit to ſpeak of the hypotheſis or hypotheticall connexion of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Now for the Aſſumption, it containes theſe three aſſertions. The firſt, that the Word of God neceſſary to the ſalvation of the Church was firſt delivered by the Prophets and afterwards by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which is manifeſt by the place alledged. <hi>In time paſt God ſpake unto the Fathers by the Prophets, but in theſe laſt daies he ſpake unto us by his Sonne.</hi> Which is alſo to be extended unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by whom Chriſt ſpake, as is manifeſt out of the ſecond chapter of this Epiſtle, penned by the ſame Apoſtle, verſ. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoke by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us that heard him?</hi> And in the 20. of Saint <hi>John</hi> ver. 21. <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 10. ver. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, &amp;c.</hi> Neither can you, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> or any deny but that the doctrine of the Goſpell was penned and written by the Apoſtles. The ſecond aſſertion of my Aſſumption was this, that the Word of God delivered by the Prophets is onely to be found in their writings. And that is evident from the frequent uſe of ſpeaking in the holy Scripture, which by the Prophets un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the writings of the holy Prophets. As in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.</hi> chap. 1. v. 1, 2. <hi>The Goſpell of God promiſed by the Prophets in the holy Scriptures.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 16. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 6. verſ. 45. <hi>It is written in the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 26. verſ. 27. <hi>King Agrippa, believeſt thou the Prophets? Luke</hi> 24. v. 27. <hi>And begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Moſes, and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelfe,</hi> and the ſame verſ. 44. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle chap. 1. verſ. 19. <hi>By the word of Propheſie</hi> underſtands the writings of the Prophets, as by the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is evident, <hi>For the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And many more places to this purpoſe might be produced, which I omit, the truth being ſo well knowne. Neither can any Papiſt produce an inſtance or preſident to the contrary. The third aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Aſſumption is this, that there can no reaſon be given
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:158688:74"/>by the Papiſts, why the ſame ſhould not be determined and ordered concerning the word of God delivered by Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles, that is concluded or determined concerning the Word of God delivered by the Prophets, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole Word of God, as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the knowledge, faith and ſalvation of the Church, &amp; as much as was requiſite for their good, is delivered and ſet downe in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles. Therefore, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> when the Papiſts doe affirme that there is a diſſimilitude in this part or matter, till they can ſhew a reaſon, and that a theologicall reaſon, and grounded upon the Word of God, they ſay nothing, and the argument will for ever hold, and the concluſion remaine unmoveable, that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are to be found in the writings of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and that we have no need of any Traditions for the making of the Scriptures a compleat rule, as the Church of Rome doth impiouſly and malignantly conclude. I confeſſe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> that I have been very large in this theame, but I formerly gave you a reaſon of it, and if I yet ſay a little more to confirme the truth, and for the farther convincing of errour, and to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the poore deluded people, I hope you will excuſe me. I therefore ſhall adde a few more reaſons and proofes for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the al-ſufficiency of the holy Scriptures, and that they have no need of any humane Traditions for the making of them a compleat rule. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the third of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> verſ. 15. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeake after the manner of men, though it be but a mans covenant or teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſanulleth or addeth thereto.</hi> Out of which words I thus argue. <hi>If the Scripture of the new Teſtament be a Covenant, and it be not lawfull to adde unto a Covenant, then it is not lawfull to adde any thing to the Scriptures of the new Teſtament. But the antecedent is true: ergo, the conſequent;</hi> and by vertue of the conſequent, no Traditions not written by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nor no unwritten verities, as you terme them, are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or entertained by the Church of God, as to be a rule of their faith, to be joyned to the Scriptures. The connexion is cleare. The aſſumption hath two parts. The firſt is manifeſt from the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and hath no need of any other proofe. The latter is proved out of the words of the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to adde, no not to a mans covenant or teſtament, and then this concluſion with farre greater reaſon will enſue and follow, that it is much leſſe lawfull to adde unto Gods owne Covenant and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:158688:74"/>And they that doe adde their traditions unto the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the new Teſtament, doe that which is unlawfull, unjuſt and impious, and bring that curſe and plague upon themſelves, that is pronounced, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. v. 18, 19. <hi>If any man ſhall adde unto theſe things,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>God ſhall adde unto him the plagues that are written in this booke. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the booke of this propheſie, God ſhall take away his part out of the booke of life, and out of the holy City, and from the things which are written in this booke.</hi> That, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that is ſpoke of this Propheſie, is ſpoke of the whole Scriptures, and therefore they that accuſe the holy Scriptures of imperfection, and adde their impious and vaine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions unto them, are guilty both of addition and detraction to them, and make themſelves obnoxious to that fearefull curſe: but the Church of England dares neither adde or take from either the old or new Teſtament, but acknowledge them both to be a moſt compleat rule, and to containe all things in them neceſſary to the ſalvation of the Church, and to have no need of unwritten verities. But that I may farther confirme the truth, and convince the erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of the Church of Rome, I thus argue. If the holy Scriptures of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets containe all things in them that pertaine unto the old Teſtament, and in expreſſe words call it a Covenant or Teſtament, and the bookes of the new Teſtament doe not comprehend all thoſe things that belong unto the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which is alſo called a Covenant in thoſe Divine writings, then the Scripture of the old Teſtament is perfecter than the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the new Teſtament, or neither of them both anſwer to their inſcription: but the conſequent is moſt falſe, impious and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; falſe likewiſe and impious muſt the antecedent needs be. For the conſequence, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> of this hypotheticall connexion, it is manifeſt from the very inſcriptions of both the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, who are called Covenants or Teſtaments. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſecond of <hi>Corinth.</hi> chap. 3. ver. 14. ſpeaking there of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets cals them a Covenant or Teſtament, in theſe words, <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>untill this day remaineth the ſame vaile untaken away, in the reading of the old Teſtament: which vaile is done away in Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 29. of <hi>Deut.</hi> v. 21. <hi>According,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to all the curſes of the covenant, that are written in this booke of the Law.</hi> And in the ſecond of the <hi>Kings,</hi> chap. 23. ver. 21. it is called <hi>the booke of the Covenant.</hi> The holy Scriptures of the new Teſtament
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:158688:75"/>alſo are in many places called a Covenant or Teſtament; as in that place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. v. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. ver. 20. And it is moſt certaine, that the Scriptures both of the old and new Teſtament anſwer unto their inſcription and title: neither can there any thing be produced that is not contained in the writings of the holy Prophets, that can truly be ſaid to belong unto the old Teſtament, and the knowledge and faith of which thought neceſſary to the ſalvation of thoſe that lived under the old Teſtament. Now if the ſame be not concluded or granted, concerning the new Teſtament, who will not eaſily from thence inferre, that the Scripture of the old Teſtament is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter then that of the new, and that the Scriptures of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Evangeliſts doe not anſwer to their inſcription and title, and this title or inſcription <hi>the new Teſtament</hi> ſhould be interpreted <hi>ſomething belonging unto the new Teſtament?</hi> which how abſurd it is, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> you your ſelfe will eaſily perceive, and therefore that has no need of any farther proofe. But for any man to thinke or ſay, that the Scripture of the new Teſtament is leſſe perfect than that of the old, is to give the Spirit of God the lie, and to overthrow all the doctrine of the holy Apoſtles, and to deny their expreſſe words, as thoſe of <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſecond of the <hi>Corinth.</hi> chap. 3. ver. 8. and ver. 18. and them of 2. <hi>Peter,</hi> chap. 1. ver. 19. where the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> comparing the Scriptures of the old Teſtament and the new together, he compares the old to a candle, and the new to a Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre; Neither yet Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> have I ever ſeene that Chriſtian that durſt affirme the Scriptures of the old Teſtament to be more perfect than them of the new; ſo that this may ſuffice to have ſpoke for proofe of my Aſſumption, and from the proofe of it I conclude, that the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, as they anſwer to their title and inſcription, ſo no man ought under paine and danger of execration to adde unto them, or detract from them, therefore they have all things in them neceſſary for the ſalvation of the Church, without the Traditions of men, or their unwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Much more, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> could I ſpeake for proofe of this truth, and to the which you ſhould never be able to anſwer, but that I would not weary you, or trouble your patience; but leſſe than this I could not ſpeake. And all that I have here ſet down doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare unto you theſe two things: Firſt, that the Church of Rome doth onely in word acknowledge Chriſts Prophetical Office, &amp; allow him to be a Prophet, but in deeds and workes deny it, when
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:158688:75"/>they heare him in nothing, and not onely take away the Scriptures out of the hands of the people, for whoſe cauſe they were written, with a ſpeciall command alſo that they ſhould read them, with a bleſſing added unto the command, but affirm that they were acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally written, and not by the command of God, and that they are obſcure and darke, and that they are not perfect and compleat in themſelves without the Traditions of the Church, Councels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the decrees of Synods be joyned to them: all which are not onely impious and blaſphemous tenents, but, as I ſaid before, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole Propheticall Office of Chriſt, and all Chriſtian Religion, and bring in other Prophets, and another Law, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the ſerving of God, which they themſelves have deviſed; by all which they prove themſelves to be no true Church, and not to be the pillar and ground of truth, but the very baſis of all errour and abomination, and this is the firſt thing that reſulteth from the concluſion of this diſcourſe. The ſecond is this, that when the Church of England holdeth and believeth all theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is the onely Prophet of his Church, and onely to be heard, &amp; that he hath fully revealed the will of God to his Church, and that the Scriptures were written by the command of God himſelfe, and that they are not obſcure, but cleare and perſpicuous, and that they ought to be read of the people, and that they containe all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, without the addition of any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, it followeth that ſhe thinketh and believeth farre more honourably of the Propheticall Office of Chriſt, than the Church of Rome, and that ſhe believeth as ſhe ought to believe, and is built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and is the ground and pillar of truth, and onely dependeth upon the Word and voice of Chriſt her true, ſole, and alone Prophet. And now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I am come to the laſt thing I undertooke to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are tied to the written Word of God, to the end of the world, as we finde it penned in the holy Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, and that the written Word of God, and that onely, is to be the rule of our faith and manners, and that we are not to ſwarve or to depart from it, or to liſten to any doctrines whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that are not either grounded upon the expreſſe words of the Scripture, or neceſſarily and infallibly deduced from them, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in matters of faith of any Traditions, Councels, or Fathers, no farther than they are conſentany and agreeable to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yea that wee ought not to liſten to any doctrines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:158688:76"/>are contrary to the revealed Will of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though the Apoſtles themſelves ſhould riſe from the dead to teach us otherwaies than we have been taught, or a very Angel from Heaven; and all this, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I ſhall prove by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing teſtimonies of holy Scripture, and then I will conclude expecting the performance of your promiſe, and your returne to your mother the Church of England, whom you have without any due reaſon formerly deſerted. I ſhall therefore gather up all the proofes that have here and there been occaſionally ſet downe in the foregoing Treatiſe, and adde ſome other to them, and that in good order, that ſo you may have them all preſented to your view at once, for the confirming of this truth, that the holy Scriptures are the onely rule of our faith, obedience and manners, and that we ought onely to cleave unto them. And I will begin with the old Teſtament firſt, out of the which heare what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. v. 2. <hi>Ye ſhall not adde,</hi> ſaith the Lord, unto the Word, <hi>which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that you may keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord your God which I command you.</hi> And in chap. 5. ver. 32. <hi>Yee ſhall obſerve to doe therefore, as the Lord your God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you: you ſhall not turne aſide to the right hand, or to the left.</hi> And Chap. 12. ver. 32. <hi>What thing ſoever I command you, obſerve to doe it. Thou ſhalt not adde thereto nor diminiſh from it.</hi> And <hi>Proverb.</hi> 30. ver. 6. <hi>Adde not thou to his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyer.</hi> Out of all which words theſe two concluſions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow, the firſt that the holy Scriptures were the onely rule that the people of God in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time were tied unto, and from the which they ought not to decline or ſwarve either to the right hand or to the left. The ſecond thing, that the Scriptures then had no need of the Traditions of men for the making of them a compleat rule, for all men were forbidden either <hi>to adde unto them or diminiſh from them.</hi> And if the holy Scriptures in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time were the rule of direction unto all Iſrael, and unto the which they were preciſely tied in regard of its perfection, then, after the writings of the Prophets, and the writings of the Apoſtles have beene joyned and annexed to the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we may truely conclude that the Scriptures now containing all thoſe things in them, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith of which is neceſſary to ſalvation, are not only a perfect rule, but that likewiſe we are ſtill under the ſame command, bound and tied to make the written Word of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament the rule of our faith and manners, and that onely. For the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:158688:76"/>hypotheticall connexion, it is manifeſt and cleare not only from the identity of the Word of God, but from the multitude of the bookes that were afterward penned and written, both as well by the holy Prophets, as the bleſſed Apoſtles, as hath abundantly been proved in the precedent diſcourſe: for the Aſſumption, it is ſufficiently proved by the places above quoted. Now, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> if the Papiſts ſhall affirme, that theſe places cited by <hi>Moſes</hi> are not to be reſtrained to the Word of God written by him, they ſhall not onely oppoſe the truth it ſelfe, but fight againſt the very light of reaſon, and deny innumerable other expreſſe Texts of Scripture all which doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly preclude and hinder them from all waies of evaſion: For in <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. ver. 4. it is ſaid, that <hi>Moſes wrote all the words of the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. ver. 9. <hi>Moſes wrote this Law.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. ver. 58. <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to doe all the words of this Law, that are written in this booke, that thou mayſt feare this glorious and fearefull Name the Lord thy God.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 24. <hi>I believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</hi> And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. v. 19. <hi>And it come to paſſe, when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſſe himſelfe in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walke in the imagination of mine heart, to adde drunkenneſse to thirſt, the Lord ſhall not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this booke ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And in the 30 chap. ver. 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keepe his Commandements and his Statutes, which are written in this booke of the Law.</hi> From all which places, and many more that might be produced, it is manifeſt that the Word of God, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, is to be underſtood of the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that it is not to be expounded or drawne to any unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions delivered by <hi>Moſes, viva voce,</hi> and therefore that the written word by <hi>Moſes</hi> was onely to be the rule which all Iſrael were tied to for the ordering of their faith, lives and manners, and that all Chriſtians at this day are much more tied and bound to cleave onely to the written Word of God in the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Which will yet be far more evident, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. ver. 18, 19, 20. and from <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. ver. 7, 8. In both which places we ſee that the Kings and Rulers themſelves are tied to the written Word, and are enjoyned to make that the rule of their lives and actions, and are commanded to meditate in it night and day, and to rule and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:158688:77"/>governe according to the ſame, without declining from it either to the right hand or to the left. And <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo in Chap. 23. ver. 6. ſendeth the people to the written Word, ſaying, <hi>Be ye therefore very couragious to keepe and doe all that is written in the booke of the Law of Moſes, that ye turne not aſide therefrom, to the right hand or to the left.</hi> This written Word was to be the rule of direction unto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no humane Traditions Maſter <hi>Montague. David</hi> likewiſe ſent all the people and his ſonne <hi>Solomon</hi> to the Law of the Lord, and commanded that they ſhould both ſeeke and keepe all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Lord their God, the 1 of <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. v. 8, 9. and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. v. 9. <hi>Wherewith,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall a young man cleanſe his way? by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed thereto according to thy Word.</hi> We ſee here <hi>David</hi> directeth all men to the Word of God, to the written Law, affirming if they will obſerve that, that they ſhall preſerve themſelves from errour, and all manner of pollutions. And in verſ. 19. <hi>I am a ſtranger in the earth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hide not thy Commandements from me.</hi> If thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth, deſire to finde the right way to Heaven, and to be kept from by-waies, then let them follow <hi>Davids</hi> example, and pray unto God that he would not hide his Commandements from them: for the Commandements are able to direct them thither, for they are the waies that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to walke in, for the attaining unto eternall happineſſe, they are the rule that all men are to be guided by, and therefore he proclaimeth him <hi>bleſſed that delighteth in the Law of the Lord, and doth meditate in it night and day, Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>Solomon</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. v. 1, 2, 3. and in <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. v. 20, 21, 22, 23. and in many other places, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his ſonne, and all the people, to the Law of the Lord, for the rule of their lives and manners, ſaying, <hi>My ſonne, keepe thy fathers commandement, and forſake not the law of thy mother. Bind them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy necke; when thou goeſt it ſhall lead thee, and when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall keepe thee, and when thou awakeſt it ſhall talke with thee. For the Commandement is a Lampe, and the Law is light, and reproofes of inſtruction are the way of life.</hi> And in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. v. 13. <hi>Let us heare,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the concluſion of the whole matter: Feare God, and keepe his Commandements, for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> By all which places it appeareth, that the holy Prophets made the written Word of God, and that onely, the rule of their lives and manners, and commanded all people to have ever recourſe unto that, and that onely, for the ſquare to order their lives by. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:158688:77"/>
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the 8. v. 20. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>if they ſpake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> There was no other rule, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> knowen to the Prophets, for the directing of the people how to ſerve God, and to which they were tied, but the Law and Teſtimonies, the written Word; and if under the Law, they were ever to have recourſe unto the Scripture, and nothing in matter of faith was to be received, which was not contained in the Scripture, it was then a perfect rule, and the onely rule by which they were to be guided; and much more now Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> ought we to content our ſelves with the Word of God, and to make that the onely rule of our faith and manners and of all our doctrines, when the doctrine of the Goſpell alſo written by the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts is joyned unto the Law, the which hath alſo fully explained the meaning of all thoſe hidden myſteries, and ſhadowes, and brought us into the cleare ſunſhine of all truths, and hath indeed taught us the way, the truth, and the life. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alſo in the 6 chap. verſ. 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand yee in the wayes and ſee, and aske for the old pathes, where is the good way, and walke therein, and yee ſhall finde reſt unto your ſoules.</hi> Here the Prophet ſends them to the Law and the Teſtimony, that old way, and tells them the benefit that will accrue unto them by following his counſell, <hi>viz.</hi> That by it they ſhall finde reſt unto their ſoules. And the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> 4. verſ. 4. <hi>Remember yee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>my ſervant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Jſrael, with the ſtatutes and judgments.</hi> The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets was the rule, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that all Iſrael was tied unto, as that which was an abſolute and perfect rule of direction, from which they were bound not to ſwarve, and which had no neede of any Traditions for the compleating of it: much more now is it a perfect rule, when the Goſpell is annexed to it; and therefore all Chriſtians ought to make the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſole rule of their faith and manners, and by all theſe precepts they are commanded, and many more, to cleave onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But now Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> let us ſee what precepts and directions wee finde layd downe unto us in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by the mouth of both theſe Witneſſes the Truth of God may yet more fully be confirmed. In <hi>Matthew</hi> 17. verſ. 51. <hi>And behold a voyce out of the clouds, which ſaid, This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed; heare you him.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 3.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:158688:78"/>verſ. 22, 23. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>truly ſaid unto the Fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe unto you of your brethren, like unto mee, him ſhall ye heare in all things whatſoever hee ſhall ſay unto you: and it ſhall come to paſſe, that every ſoule that will not heare that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from the people.</hi> Here are two things, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> obſervable: firſt, a command, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould heare Chriſt that Prophet the Lord our God ſhould raiſe up. Secondly, the danger that would inſue if we heard him not, <hi>viz.</hi> deſtruction, for that is pronounced againſt thoſe that do not heare him. Now let us take notice how he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>John</hi> 5. verſ. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith he. Here our great Prophet, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> ſendeth us onely to the Scriptures, he makes them the onely rule which wee are to follow. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. in the perſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> hee ſendeth all men to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, verſ. 29. <hi>they have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let them heare them.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Montague</hi> was the old way to ſalvation, where men might finde reſt for their ſoules, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Chriſt the onely Prophet of his Church ſend all men, to the holy Scriptures and to the Doctrines contained in them as the abſolute and compleat rule that all the Chriſtians are for ever tied to; and out of the Scriptures, and them onely, did Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme all his preaching, as is evident out of <hi>Luke</hi> 24. and many other places, averring that the people erred, not knowing the Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. The Apoſtles likewiſe in all their Sermons and Writings did the ſame, and inoyned all Chriſtians to cleave unto the holy Scriptures, and to make them onely the rule of their faith and manners, as by the places following do moſt cleerly appeare. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 16 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 17.18. <hi>Now I beſeech you brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>marke them which cauſe diviſion and offences, contrary unto the doctrine yee have received, and avoyd them, for they that are ſuch ſerve not our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but their owne belly, and by good words and faire ſpeeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hearts of the ſimple.</hi> Here the holy Apoſtle ties the <hi>Romans</hi> unto the doctrine they had received, and which he writ unto them, and forbids them to have any communication with any members of that Church that ſhould teach contrary unto that Doctrine they had received: <hi>for they that are ſuch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All therefore, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that teach any Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the written word ſwarve from the truth and are not by the Apoſtles command to be communicated with, and therefore the written Word muſt be the onely rule of our direction. And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:158688:78"/>in the 4 of the 1 of <hi>Cor.</hi> verſ. 6. Hee commands <hi>them not to be wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that that is written, tying them ever</hi> to the doctrine that is ſet down in the written Word, and in that, forbidding them to liſten unto any Traditions of men, or unwritten verities. <hi>For if we muſt not be wiſe above that which is written, and the opinions and doctrines of faith belong unto true wiſdome, then wee ought in matters of faith to be contented ſolely with the Scriptures and onely to cleave and ſtick unto that rule: But the antecedent is true:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The conſequent.</hi> The connexion is manifeſt, and for the aſſumption the place cited proves it. But if this place, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> be underſtood, as it is expounded by many learned men, that <hi>Paul</hi> has reference here, to the things which himſelfe had writ to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and others, and that he binds the <hi>Corinthians</hi> here, to the things pend by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and that which he had writ, and injoynes them not to be wiſe above that, then by how much more are all the whole Scriptures ſufficient, and with how much the more care, ought we to take heed, that wee be not wiſe above that which is written both in the old and new Teſtament? for that muſt needs be a compleate rule to which, with greater reaſon all men are for evertied unto, if the very writings of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> are ſo perfect, that no man ought to be wiſe or learned above that which hee hath written. From the which I thus argue, <hi>Whoſoever propounds or eſtabliſhes any doctrines or opinions of Faith from unwritten Traditions, is wiſe above that which is written. But no Chriſtian truly obedient to the Apoſtolicall doctrine, is wiſe above that which is written:</hi> Ergo, <hi>no Chriſtian truly obedient to the Apoſtolicall Doctrine, doth propound or eſtabliſh any Doctrines or opinions of Faith from unwritten Traditions.</hi> But to goe on. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 8, 9. <hi>Though wee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>or an Angell from Heaven preach unto you otherwiſe, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed, as wee ſaid before, ſo ſay J now againe, if any men preach unto you otherwiſe, then that yee have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> The Apoſtle here doubles the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if he could have uſed no argument ſufficient enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre them from liſtning unto any doctrines contrary to that which they had received, tying them only to the written Word, the which they ought to make the onely rule of their faith, and from the which they might not ſwarve, though the Apoſtles themſelves, or an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach them otherwiſe under a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe and execration. And as he ſets downe the danger that will
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:158688:79"/>follow to all ſuch as diſobay theſe his injunctions, ſo in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this his Epiſtle, hee pronounces a bleſſing upon all ſuch as ſhall be conformable to the rule, preſcribed unto them for their farther incouragement, in theſe words, Chap. 6. verſ. 16. <hi>And as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as walke according to this rule, peace be unto them and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> Mercy therefore and peace, is the reward of all the faithfull, and obedient to this rule, and to ſuch as cleave onely to the Scriptures, and a curſe to all thoſe that are diſobedient, and ſuch as liſten unto unwritten Traditions. And in the fourth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> exhorting them all that <hi>with lowlineſſe and meekneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> they would indeavour to keepe the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, he gives them a reaſon of his exhortation ſaying, that there is but one body, and one ſpirit, and one hope, and one Lord, and one faith, and one Baptiſme, and one God and Father of all, and therefore that they ſhould imploy that Talent of grace that God had given them for the keeping of the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. And that they might the better doe this, hee tells them, that the Lord gave them Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the Church, till they come unto the unity of the Faith, &amp;c. and declares unto them withall, that they have fully diſcharged their duty, and revealed and taught the whole Will of God unto them, and alſo writ it, to this very end, verſ. 14. <hi>That wee henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with every wind of Doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lie in waite to deceive.</hi> In the which words, he giveth the reaſon why the Word of God was written, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might have a certaine rule to walke by, and to which they were only to adhere and conſtantly to cleave unto, and not to be removed from it, if they deſired to keepe the unity of the faith, and not be carried about with every wind of Doctrine. So that by this very place, it is manifeſt the written Word is to be the onely rule, and not unwritten verities or humane Traditions. And in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. verſ. 16. <hi>Nevertheleſse,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whereto we have already attained, let us walke by the ſame rule, let us minde the ſame things.</hi> Here alſo hee tieth them to the rule the written Word from which they might not ſwarve. And to the <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> chap. 2. verſ. 8. <hi>Beware,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>leſt any may ſpoyle you through philoſophy and vaine deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt: for in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:158688:79"/>him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily, and yee are compleat in him, who is the head of all principality and power,</hi> and in verſ. 18.19, 20, 21, 22. of the ſame chapter the Apoſtle reproveth them, <hi>that they were ſubject unto the ordinances after the Commandements, and Doctrines of men.</hi> So that in this very chapter hee proveth that the Word of God is ſufficiently perfect for the bringing us unto Chriſt in whom wee are compleat, and forbids them to liſten unto the Traditions and Ordinances of men, with whatſoever ſeeming ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments out of philoſophy and humane wiſdome they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto them, and enjoins them onely to cleave unto the written word, and to the revealed will of God in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not to ſerve God after the Commandements and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, ſhewing them the danger of ſo doing; for, ſaith he, they ſeparate us from the head Chriſt Jeſus, and bring us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And if wee looke through all the Epiſtles of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, wee ſhall finde in them all ſpeciall caveats to take heede of all Traditions of men, and ſpeciall charge given them, to cleave onely to that Doctrine and thoſe inſtructions that they in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings had ſet downe unto them; for, for that very end they writ their letters unto them, as they teſtify themſelves, that after their departure out of this life, they might have a certaine rule to walk by, by the following and obſerving of the which they might not onely be preſerved from all the errors of the times, but be kept unblameable to the appearing and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and bee filled with all ſaving knowledge. And truly, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> all reaſon dictates unto us, that if the holy Apoſtles in their writings give precepts unto all the Paſtors and Teachers of the Church, how they ſhall teach, and inſtruct the people, and preſcribe unto them a rule which they are ever to follow, and from which they may not ſwarve in their preaching, and injoyne them withall, to keepe that rule unblameable untill the ſecond comming of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and in thoſe inſtructions among other things, in ſpeciall, charge them to take heed of all the Traditions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men in Gods ſervice, and injoyne them alſo, to reprove ſuch as teach any other doctrine than that they have received from them, and alſo command to ſhun and decline them that teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that doctrine; I ſay, as the Miniſters of the Goſpell have a rule ſet them by which they ſhall teach, and from which they may not vary, if they notwithſtanding will goe beyond their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:158688:80"/>and teach contrary, yet the people are not to liſten unto them or to heare, them in ſo doing: for they are bound and tied like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the ſame rule and written word to the contrary, as by the places above ſpecified is manifeſt, and many more that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> let us a little examine what <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and in them to all Miniſters, and Teachers, and what rules hee preſcribeth unto them in their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and what rules after in the following Epiſtles and Writings of the Apoſtles, are given to all Chriſtians. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his 1 Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> before he comes to any particular inſtructions gives him a reaſon why he left him at <hi>Epheſus</hi> when he went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that was, ſaith he, verſ. 3.4. <hi>That thou mighteſt charge ſome that they teach no other Doctrine, neither give heed to fables, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ties all Miniſters to the rule, the Doctrine that they had received from him and the other Apoſtles. And accounts all the Traditions of men fables and vanities, as in the third Chapter he more fully declareth, and in the 16 verſe, he ſaith, <hi>Take heede unto thy ſelfe, and unto thy doctrine, continue in them, for in doing this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelfe, and them that heare thee.</hi> Here hee ties <hi>Timothy</hi> to the rule, and tells him withall of the benefit that will redound unto him and others continuing in it, and that is the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation both of him and his hearers. So that the ſwarving from it, muſt needs be pernicious to both Teachers and Hearers. And in the 5 chap. 21. <hi>J charge thee before God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and the Lord Jeſus, and the elect Angels that thou obſerve theſe things, without preferring one before an other.</hi> And in chap. 6. verſ. 3. <hi>Jf,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>any man teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe and conſent not to the wholeſom words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the doctrine which is according to godlineſſe, &amp;c. from ſuch withdraw thy ſelfe.</hi> Here againe, he ties him to the rule, to the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the doctrine taught by Chriſt, as it is ſet down in the ſeverall Goſpells, and commands <hi>Timothy</hi> to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from all ſuch as taught not according to that doctrine, and in verſ. 13.14. <hi>I give thee charge,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>in the ſight of God, who quickneth all things, and before Chriſt Ieſus, who before</hi> Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion; that thou keepe this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement without ſpot, untill the appearing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is a rule given to the end of the World, which all Teachers and Hearers are bound to obſerve and keepe. The Miniſters and preachers by it, are to teach nothing contrary unto the wholeſome
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:158688:80"/>words and doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and what hee taught, and the people, they are not to receive or heare any thing contrary to that doctrine: but both Miniſters and people are commanded to ſhunne ſuch, and to withdraw themſelves from them. And in his ſecond Epiſtle, as if the Apoſtle could never ſufficiently enough have taught all Miniſters their duty, in Chap. 1. verſ. 13. <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the forme of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of mee, in faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Have a ſpeciall care, thou varieſt not from that way of teaching thou haſt learned from mee, the two principall heads of the which doctrine, or the ſum of which is faith and charity, teach them the ſaving doctrine of faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I taught it, according to the written Word, ground all thy preaching concerning faith, upon the Scripture, not upon the vaine Traditions of men, and humane authority, but upon the written word. So likewiſe, when thou teacheſt them their duty of love, both towards God, and towards their Neighbours, and one towards another, inſtruct them in that according to the written Word, and not after the Precepts and commandements of men, and from this way of preaching ſwarve thou not, <hi>but hold faſt that forme of ſound Words,</hi> for ſo I taught thee. And in Chap. 3. verſ. 14. <hi>Continue thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the things which thou haſt learned and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them.</hi> Here againe, hee injoynes him to preſeverance in that doctrine onely, which he had taught him, who was guided by the Spirit of God, and confirmed all that hee taught out of the Scriptures, and therefore there could be no doubt of the Truth of it, and that he commands <hi>Timothy</hi> and all other Miniſters to continue in their Teaching, and not to vary from it, or to give eare or heed unto the Traditions of men. And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 13.14. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>rebuke them ſharply, that they my be ſound in the Faith; Not giving heed to Jewiſh fables, and commandements of men, which turne from the truth.</hi> What, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> can be ſpoke more evident, againſt all Traditions of men, which teach, that the worſhip of God conſiſteth in outward performances, as in the obſervation of dayes and ceremonies, and abſtaining from Meats and Marriage, all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of crafty men, and which teach that wee muſt worſhip God according to the commandements of men? when the Apoſtle in expreſſe words in Chap. 3. of the 1 of <hi>Timothy</hi> verſ. 12, 3. affirmes, that theſe are the doctrines of Devills, and in this place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158688:81"/>
               <hi>Titus</hi> ſharply, roughly, and plainely to reprove all ſuch prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as teach men by ſuch performances to ſerve God, or inſtruct them to worſhip him after the commandements and traditions of men, and gives him a reaſon why <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould ſharply rebuke ſuch teachers, becauſe, ſaith he, they that indoctrinate the people in this manner to ſerve God, are ſo far from teaching the truth, as they turn them from it, and lead them into errours and by-waies, to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perdition. Truely, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> if there were but this very Text in all the new Teſtament for our direction, for the right ſerving of God, it were enough for ever to deterre us from the traditions of men, and to make us cleave cloſe to the written Word for our rule, when the Apoſtle pronounceth all ſuch doctrines, either to be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of devils, or at leaſt to lead and turn us from the truth, which we ought to preferre before our lives. And in Chap. 3. ver. 10. <hi>A man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that is an hereticke, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject.</hi> You know, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> that he is counted an heretick among you, that continues obſtinate, and perſeveres in his owne opinions, againſt the doctrines of the Church of Rome, and their vaine tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and humane inventions; but in Gods Dialect, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted orthodox; and they onely in the holy Scriptures are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretickes that perſevere and continue in their owne unſound opinions, contrary to the faith once delivered unto the Saints, and to the wholſome words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch onely by S. <hi>Paul</hi> are proclaimed hereticks, with a command unto all Miniſters and people, after the firſt and ſecond admonition to reject, and to caſt them out of the Church, as people with whom godly men, and the true Diſciples of Chriſt ought to have no fellowſhip, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: and therefore Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> the doctrine of the holy Apoſtles, as it is ſet downe in Scriptures, is the rule we are tied to for the diſcerning betweene true and falſe doctrine, and that we are for ever to have before our eyes, for the ſquare we muſt regulate our faith and manners by. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. ver. 8, 9. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Be not carried about with ſtrange doctrines, &amp;c.</hi> here the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all men to liſten unto the vaine Traditions of men, and to be carried about with any ſtrange doctrines, ſuch as are not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the written Word, and conformable to the rule of our faith, ſet downe in it, and gives a reaſon why they ſhould be ſtable and unmoveable in that doctrine; for, ſaith he, Chriſt which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158688:81"/>is the object of our faith, doth not change his nature nor quality in his Perſon, Office, and Doctrine; and therefore it beſeemes you likewiſe to be ſolid, firme and ſtable, and invariable in your faith in him, and that you ſhould not be carried about with ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, or give heed unto the Traditions of men, which turne you from the truth; and in this you ought alwaies to follow the rule preſcribed in the Word, and to ſet before your eyes the example of your godly teachers, <hi>which have the government over you, who have preached unto you the Word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation,</hi> verſ. 7. and how they continuing faithfull to the end, are now dead in the Lord. If you therefore deſire to be eternally bleſſed, as they are, imitate and follow them in their faith, for they were not carried about with ſtrange doctrines; but as they taught you the Word of God, and not the traditions and commandements of men, ſo cleave you alſo to that written Word, and be not carried about with <hi>ſtrange doctrines, for it is a good thing that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, all the traditions of men doe not eſtabliſh the heart with grace; for the heart is then onely eſtabliſhed with grace, when the ſoule and conſcience of a believer repoſeth it ſelfe in the true apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and feeling of the mercy, favour, and love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, apprehended by faith, and in the aſſurance of his eternall good will, when by faith they lay hold on the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and finde the worke of their ſpirituall regeneration wrought in their ſoules, which brings forth the fruit of holineſſe in all manner of converſation, and this onely eſtabliſheth the heart with grace, and in this conſiſteth the true worſhip of God; all which the traditions and commandements of men are ſo farre from teaching, as they turne us from them, placing religion in outward performances, and in obſerving of mens traditions, as worſhiping of Images, Crucifixes, and obſerving of daies, and abſtaining from meats, &amp;c. All which turne us from that ſpirituall worſhip of God, which God both commandeth and delighteth in, <hi>For God is a Spirit,</hi> and they that will worſhip him (according to his Will) <hi>muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, John</hi> 4. ver. 24. His Will therefore, Mr. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> muſt be the rule we ought ever to adhere and cleave to, if we would not be carried about with ſtrange doctrines, and if we deſire to have our hearts eſtabliſhed with grace. I might enlarge my ſelfe exceedingly in this point, and runne through both the Epiſtles of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:158688:82"/>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> and the firſt Epiſtle of Saint <hi>John,</hi> but I will conclude with that of Saint <hi>John</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, verſ. 9, 10. <hi>Whoſoever tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; he that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Sonne. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed. For he that biddeth him God ſpeed is partaker of his evill deeds.</hi> Here, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> for a concluſion of this point, take notice, that we are for ever tied to the doctrine of Chriſt, which he, the great and onely Prophet of his Church taught us, and which we finde writ in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom we are bound to heare in all things, and from the which doctrine we may not ſwarve, nor ſo much as bid God ſpeed to any that ſhall teach otherwiſe, unleſſe we will partake with them in their evill, and ſo make our ſelves lyable to the curſe and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto our diſobedience in ſo doing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. verſ. 8. which the Church of England, both out of conſcience of her duty to the command of her great Prophet Chriſt Jeſus; and out of an awfull reverence of his glorious name; and out of feare alſo, of that curſe that is denounced againſt all ſuch as tranſgreſſe his holy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and are carried about with ſtrange doctrines, and abide not in the doctrine of Chriſt, doth with all obedience ſubmit her ſelfe unto and continually cleaves unto the holy Word of God, revealed in his written Word, and makes that onely the rule of her faith and manners, and by that proveth her ſelfe to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> and to teach the way, the truth, and the life, and to honour Jeſus Chriſt, and to believe in him aright, and as ſhe ought to doe, when ſhe owneth him to be her onely King, her ſole Prieſt, and alone Prophet, and followeth the guidance of his Spirit, and approaches unto God in his name and mediation, and is directed by his Word, and heares his voice in all things; by all which, I ſay, ſhe manifeſteth to the whole world, that ſhe is a true Church againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile, and the pillar and ground of truth. On the other ſide it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the Church of Rome is not a true Church, nor the ground and pillar of truth, when ſhe is not built upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peter,</hi> nor teacheth not the way of the truth and the life, nor honoureth not Chriſt as her King, Prieſt, and Prophet, nor continueth conſtantly in the doctrines of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and in the which the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt is neither
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:158688:82"/>purely preached, nor the Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is not the true invocation of God, nor the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that Chriſt the great Prophet of his Church hath taught us; All which, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I have, as I hope, ſo ſufficiently proved in this diſcourſe, as I am moſt confident that there is not any rationall man but will eaſily perceive, and you your ſelfe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> if you have not reſolved to ſhut your eyes at noone day, will now clearely diſcerne, which of the Churches believeth beſt, and which of their faiths and beliefes is moſt orthodox concerning the Kingly, Prieſtly, and Propheticall Office of Chriſt Jeſus, and which of them giveth the Lord Jeſus moſt honour, either ſhe that neither regardeth what Chriſt commandeth or forbiddeth, or ſhe that in all things heareth his voice, and followeth the direction of his Word, as it is ſet downe in the holy Scriptures, which I have by Gods aſſiſtance proved to containe all things in it neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that wee have no need of humane traditions for the making of it a compleat rule; and that this Word is onely the ſole rule of our faith and manners, and that all Chriſtians to the end of the world are tied unto that to be the rule and ſquare both of their faith and manners, and that they ought not to ſwarve from it upon what termes ſoever. And therefore now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I ſhall look for the performance of your promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that if I could prove the Church of England to be a true Church, and that the Word of God contained all things in it neceſſary to ſalvation, and that it was the onely rule of our faith, unto which all Chriſtians were tied to the end of the world, (all which I conceive I have fully done) that then you would be of our Religion, and turne Proteſtant. This was your promiſe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> before all the Gentlemen, and the performance of the which will be to the honour of God, and your owne eternall comfort, and will ever rejoyce the heart of him that wiſheth you all happineſſe here and hereafter. But, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> before I ſhut up this diſcourſe, I ſhall in way of a corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary deſire you to ponder and ſeriouſly conſider not onely the vanity but the impiety of all thoſe tenents you hold in the Church of Rome, more than we have warrant for in the Word of God, and that you would deale ingenuouſly betweene God and your owne conſcience in the examination of a few Queries that I ſhall now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I finiſh my diſcourſe propound unto you.</p>
            <p>I deſire you, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> to anſwer mee truely, what you
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:158688:83"/>thinke of the condition of ſuch a man, as ſhall believe, that Jeſus Chriſt is the onely and ſole King and head of his Church, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his body, that infuſeth life and ſpirituall motion into it, and all ſaving graces, and that guideth it by his holy Spirit and Word, and believeth alſo that he and he onely is to be obeyed in whatſoever he commandeth or forbiddeth, and that we are not in matters of faith and doctrine to follow or heare any voyce or word but what he the King of his Church hath made knowne unto us in his Lawes and heavenly Statutes, as they are recorded in the holy Scriptures, tell me I pray, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> candidly, what you think of the condition of ſuch a man living, and dying in this faith? Can this beliefe any waies prejudice his ſalvation, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heareth of the Pope of Rome, whom you and the other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts proclaime to be head of the Church, and to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords, whoſe oracles, Lawes and Ordinances, you affirme ought to be obeyed in all things as the commands of Chriſt? I ſay if he never heares of ſo much as the name of the Pope or of any ſuch creature as he is, will not his faith in Jeſus Chriſt alone whom hee believeth to be the onely King and head of the Church and Saviour of all ſuch as truſt in him, ſave him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally? If you ſhall affirme that his thus believing will not ſave him, you overthrow the Chriſtian faith, and deſtroy the true Chriſtian religion, which teacheth us thus to believe, and aſſureth us, that living and dying in ſo believing and in this faith we ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Againe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I demand of you what you thinke of the condition of that Chriſtian that ſhall peremptorily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Pope of Rome is not the King and head of the Church militant, but that hee is the enemy of Jeſus Chriſt, one guilty of blaſphemy, as aſſuming unto himſelfe thoſe glorious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and prerogatives that are peculiar to Chriſt alone, the King of Saints, and King of Kings, and the onely head and ſole gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Church? Can this, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> his ſo believing prejudice his ſalvation, or be any ſinne againſt Almighty God? If you ſhall anſwer, that it may, then I ſhall demand your reaſon, why you conceive that it may be any way prejudiciall to his eternall happineſſe; for where there is no tranſgreſſion there is no ſinne; for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion of the Law: and what law, I beſeech you, doth that Chriſtian tranſgreſſe, that believeth that Chriſt onely is the King and head of his Church, and the Saviour of his body,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:158688:83"/>and that theſe incommunicable prerogatives peculiarly belong unto Chriſt, and that they are not to be given to any mortall man, and that it is a ſinne in any to aſſume theſe titles, or for any to give them to the Pope. Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> let me tell you that except you will overthrow the faith of the Goſpell, you can never make either the ignorance or the contempt of your Romiſh doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Popes Supremacy any ſinne, but that a man may live and die in the deteſtation of it, and be eternally ſaved, if by a ſtedfaſt and lively faith and full perſwaſion hee cleaveth unto Chriſt Jeſus the onely head and King of his Church, and believes by his alone power to be delivered out of the hands of all his bodily and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies.</p>
            <p>Againe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I deſire you to anſwer me ingenuouſly, what you thinke of the condition of ſuch a man as ſhall believe, that Chriſt Jeſus is the onely and ſole Prophet of his Church, and that he hath fully revealed the whole will and counſell of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the redemption of man-kind, and that all things neceſſary to ſalvation are fully and compleatly ſet downe in his holy Word by his command in the writings of the old and new Teſtament, and that the ſacred Scriptures are a perfect rule of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the regulating of our Faith and manners, and ought to be the onely ſquare and rule of all our thoughts, words, actions, and of our faith, and doctrines unto the end of the world, and that there is no need of any humane traditions for the compleating of them, and making of them perfect and intire, and that all doctrines that are not either grounded upon the expreſſe words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or evidently and by good conſequence deduced from thence, ought to be rejected, and to be abandoned. I pray, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> what thinke you of the ſtate and condition of ſuch a man living and dying in this faith? Can this his ſo believing any way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his eternall ſalvation, though he never heareth of any of your traditions or unwritten verities, which you notwithſtanding affirm are to be entertained with equall beliefe, that the holy Scriptures are by us received and imbraced? I ſay, if he never heare ſo much as of the name of your Traditions, and of your Councels, Canons, or In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unctions, will not his faith in the holy Scriptures alone, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the doctrine revealed in them, and believing that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all things in them neceſſary to ſalvation, ſave him eternally? If you ſhall affirme the contrary, you will not fight againſt mee, but
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:158688:84"/>againſt God himſelfe, and give the Spirit of God the lie, who hath ſo often declared that believing thoſe things that are writ in the holy Scriptures, it will ſave our ſoules.</p>
            <p>Againe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I demand of you, what you thinke of the condition of that Chriſtian, that ſhall peremptorily believe that all thoſe Traditions, of Purgatory, and humane ſatisfactions, of Will-worſhip and Image-worſhip, of Self-merits, and workes of Supererogation, of Indulgences and Pilgrimages, of praying to Saints and Angels, and all the other bundles of your Traditions thruſt upon the poore people as the ſervice of God, and the meanes by which they may pleaſe God, are deteſtable abominations, as being things full of blaſphemy, placing our redemption in other meanes than in the bloodſhed and meritorious death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and denying the perfection of the holy Scriptures, and equalizing, or rather preferring the Traditions and Inventions of the Pope, the enemy of the Lord Jeſus, before the authority of the written Word, which was dictated by the Spirit of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the onely and ſole Prophet of his Church, whom wee are commanded onely to heare and obey in all things that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his bleſſed Word, which is for ever to be the rule of our faith. Doe you conceive, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> that any Chriſtian ſo believing, and perſevering in this his beliefe unto the laſt houre of his death, it can any way prejudice his ſalvation? If you ſay it may, give me, I beſeech you, your reaſon, for ſinne onely excludeth men out of Heaven; ſhew me therefore what Law of God any Chriſtian tranſgreſſeth in believing Chriſt to be the onely Prophet of his Church, and that he hath fully revealed the Will of God his Father concerning the redemption of man-kind, and that this his Will and good pleaſure is as much as is neceſſary to the ſalvation of the Church, is fully ſet downe and contained in the holy Scriptures, and that the written Word of God is compleat in it ſelfe, without any humane Traditions, and that we are bound to make that onely the rule of our faith and manners, and to reject all doctrines what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever are not grounded upon the written Word, and much more all ſuch doctrines as lead us from Chriſt, and teach us another way to Heaven than he hath taught us, who is our onely Prophet, and another way of ſerving God than he hath appointed. I pray, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> is the obedience of any man to Chriſt our Prophets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſinne or tranſgreſſion of his holy Law? If you ſay ſo, then
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:158688:84"/>you make that a ſinne, which God accounteth of as a vertue and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his bleſſed Will and Word, and ſo by your traditions breake the Commandements of God, and our glorious Prophet Chriſt Jeſus, and by that as by all your other damnable doctrines proclaime your ſelves open tranſgreſſours of his holy Lawes, which without ſpeedy and hearty repentance will bring you to eternall perdition.</p>
            <p>Againe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I intreat you candidly to tell me, what you thinke of the condition of ſuch a man, as ſhall believe that Chriſt Jeſus is the onely and ſole Prieſt of the new Teſtament, and that hee by his obedience, death and paſſion, and by the Sacrifice of himſelfe once offered upon the Croſſe, when he was made ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne, hath reconciled God the Father unto us, and made for ever our atonement with him, and laid downe a ſufficient ranſome for our redemption, by the which we are freed from both the guilt and puniſhment due to our ſinnes and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and that the vertue of this his ſacrifice as it is ineffable and everlaſtingly able to ſave all ſuch as believe in him, ſo it is never to be reiterated, but to be applyed unto the ſoule, and hearts of men by ſuch meanes onely as God himſelfe hath appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the vertue and powerfull working and operation of the holy Ghoſt, by the preaching of the Goſpell, by the adminiſtration of the holy Sacraments, by faith and prayer, and that hee is our onely high Prieſt and Mediator both of ſatisfaction and interceſſion, by whom alone wee have continually acceſſe to the Throne of grace, and that in his Name onely and through his mediation, wee are to put up all our prayers, ſupplications and thankſgivings unto God the Father, and that there are now no reall Prieſts on earth, for the offering up of any propitiatory Sacrifice for the reconciling of God unto us, or any other Mediators in Heaven between God and us, that can make God propitious unto us, but the man Chriſt Jeſus. Tell me, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> ſincerely, what you thinke of the ſtate and condition of ſuch a man living and dying in this faith? Can this his beliefe any way prejudice his ſalvation, though he never heare of your Romiſh Prieſts, whom you affirme to be reall Prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and aſſert that they offer up the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt daily a propitiatory ſacrifice for the living and the dead? Can this his faith, I ſay, prejudice the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any man, though he never heareth ſuch doctrines as theſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:158688:85"/>be? or can this his faith prejudice his eternall happineſſe though hee never heareth of any other Mediator of the new Teſtament but Jeſus Chriſt alone, or never prayeth to Saint or Angell, to entreat their mediation for him with God the Father, but onely putteth up all his prayers and praiſes in the Name of Chriſt alone? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> tell me, if hee never heard ſo much as the name of any reall Prieſts beſides Chriſt, or of any other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor but of Jeſus Chriſt, or of any other propitiatory Sacrifice, but of that onely which Chriſt offered to God the Father upon the Croſſe, will not this his faith in Jeſus Chriſt alone, his onely high Prieſt and Mediator, and the aſſurance hee hath of the vertue and al-ſufficiency of that his Sacrifice once offered to God, eternally ſave his ſcule, and bring him to life and happineſſe? Take heed, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> what you ſay. For, if you affirme the contrary, you blaſpheme, and overthrow not onely the whole worke of our redemption, but indeed deny the faith, and deſtroy all Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Againe, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I deſire you further to reſolve me, what you thinke of the condition of ſuch a Chriſtian as ſhall perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily living and dying believe, that there are no reall Prieſts now upon earth after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> appointed daily to offer up the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt to God the Father a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice for the living and the dead: and that there are no other Mediators in Heaven, in whoſe Name and by whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion wee may put up our prayers, ſupplications, and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings unto God the Father, beſides Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall not onely conſtantly believe all this, but ſhall alſo confidently affirme, that to bring into the Church of God any other reall Prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> beſides Jeſus Chriſt, or any other propitiatory Sacrifice beſides the Sacrifice that he once offered to God the Father upon the Croſſe, or to appoint any other Mediator in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Jeſus Chriſt, are all the doctrines of high blaſphemy, as dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the honour and dignity of Chriſt Jeſus, the onely high-Prieſt, and ſole Mediator of the everlaſting covenant, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and prejudiciall to the ſalvation of mankind, as teaching them another way to Heaven, then by the meritorious death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe precious blood alone, and not by any fading things wee have redemption and remiſſion of our ſins <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. v. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. v. 14. &amp; 1 <hi>Peter</hi> chap. 1. v. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. &amp; 13.12. &amp; 1 <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:158688:85"/>chap. 1. ver. 7. Tell me, I ſay, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> if any Chriſtian ſhall peremptorily unto the laſt houre of his life perſevere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this faith and beliefe, and will by no art of perſwaſion be induced to believe any of thoſe horrid and pernicious doctrines which you of the Church of Rome ſuggeſt and impoſe upon the poore people, to their eternall deſtruction; will, I pray you, this his ſo believing and living and dying in this faith deprive him of happineſſe, or any waies hinder the eternall ſalvation of his ſoule? or ſhall hee by this his ſtedfaſt faith and reſolution doe any thing diſpleaſing unto God, or ſinne in ſo believing? If you ſhall affirme that it will, you muſt ſhew what Law of God hee tranſgreſſeth in ſo believing, for where there is no tranſgreſſion of a Law of God, there is no ſinne. Now what Law of God, I beſeech you, is there in all the holy Scripture that maketh it a ſinne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is no other reall Prieſt of the new Teſtament, no other Mediator of the everlaſting covenant but Jeſus Chriſt, no other propitiatory Sacrifice, but that which hee once offered upon the Croſſe, no other way of redemption and of obtaining remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſinnes, but by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt? Untill Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> you can make it appeare, that thus to believe is a ſinne, you can never evince and prove any man guilty of tranſgreſſion by abhorring and rejecting all your impious doctrines of the Church of Rome concerning your blaſphemous Prieſts, and propitiatory Sacrifices and new found out Mediators, and novell waies of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining remiſſion of ſinnes. Truely, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to make it appeare to all men, that there is never a tenent the Church of Rome holdeth more then wee believe in the Church of England, but it is either blaſphemous, impious, or at leaſt ſuperfluous; ſo that a man may die either in the ignorance or contempt of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to his eternall ſalvation, and that by the confeſſion of the very Romaniſts themſelves that have not reſigned their reaſon or abjured all underſtanding. I writ once about this very thing, to one <hi>Siniones</hi> a Jeſuit, a fellow-priſoner with me in the Gatehouſe, which you if you pleaſe may read in my <hi>Flagello Pontificis</hi> of the laſt edition, which is yet unanſwered. But now, Maſter <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> to returne to the buſineſſe in hand, and to ſpeake yet a word or two of your diabolicall Sacrifice of the Maſſe, which you call a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the living and the dead, but in truth the moſt abominable Idoll that ever the world yet ſaw, being indeed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:158688:86"/>that poyſoned Wine in a goulden Cup, that hath made drunk the Nations of the Earth, that are under the power and Dominion of the whore of Babylon, and that that bringeth in an other way of ſalvation than by the death and ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, by which onely wee have redemption, the remiſſion of our ſinnes; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of the which, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> I ſhall deſire you a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and then I will conclude and leave you to your meditations and ſoliloquies. But it will not be amiſſe to ſet downe, what both the Church of <hi>England</hi> believeth concerning the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt; and what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, concerning that: That ſo our opinions on both ſides being truly weighed, every one may judge which of their beliefes is moſt ſound, and withall may the better perceive the deteſtable impiety of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>believeth that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſole high-Prieſt and onely reall Prieſt of the new Teſtament, and that his ſacrifice once offered upon the croſſe, is that onely, reall and externall ſacrifice in the Chriſtian Church, and that that ſacrifice is the onely propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſins of mankind, and that there is no other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believeth <hi>that in that action they call the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, there is a true reall and externall ſacrifice, in the which their Prieſts whom they blaſphemouſly tearme Prieſts after the order of</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech, <hi>do dayly offer up unto God the Father, the very body and the very bloud of Ieſus Chriſt under the ſpecies and formes of Bread and Wine, and affirme that this is a propitiatory ſacrifice for the living and for the dead, and that Chriſt himſelfe is here really preſent in the hands of their Prieſts and upon their Altars, and offered up by them to God the Father and that it is the ſame Sacrifice that Chriſt offered upon the croſſe; and injoyne all the people to put their truſt in it for ſalvation, and to give the ſame Divine worſhip unto it under paine of death, that is to be given to Chriſt himſelfe the Saviour of the World.</hi> This, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> you know to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the which nothing can be more blaſphemouſly or idolatrically taught, and believed, or be more fraught with impieties, or more contrary to all both faith and reaſon, or more pernicious to the ſalvation of the ſonnes of men. But I will not now, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> diſcover all the errors and abominations of this Idoll, onely I ſhall deſire you to take notice of the great impiety and abſurdities of this your doctrine. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> affirmeth, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> that the ſacrifice of this idoll Maſſe, is the very ſame ſacrifice that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:158688:86"/>offered upon the croſſe. Againſt which I thus argue. <hi>That Sacrifice which differeth from the Sacrifice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both in the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, materiall, formall and finall cauſe, that is not the ſame ſacrifice that Chriſt offered upon the croſſe: but the ſacrifice of the Maſſe differeth from the ſacrifice of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, both in the efficient, materiall, formall and finall cauſe:</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not the ſame ſacrifice, but a deteſtable Idoll.</hi> For the Major, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> no man will deny it, for that that doth <hi>re &amp; ratione diſſentire</hi> from any thing, that is not the ſame, as all men know. The Minor I will prove with its ſeverall parts. And thus I diſpute. <hi>The ſacrifice of the croſſe, was offered up by that high-Prieſt who is the eternall Sonne of the eternall Father, who is holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, undifiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher than the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 7. verſ. 28. <hi>Who through the eternall Spirit, offered himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot to God.</hi> Heb. 9 verſ. 14. <hi>But the Sacrifice of the maſſe is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up by this Prieſt, nor through the eternall Spirit: but by a moſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Prieſt and through the Spirit of Antichriſt:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the ſacrifice of the Maſse is not the ſame ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt, it differing from it in the efficient cauſe, but a moſt deteſtable Idoll.</hi> The Major of this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme you cannot deny, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> neither will any man gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay or deny the Minor, and you know then, the concluſion neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily followeth that the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and the ſacrifice of the Maſſe are not one and the ſame Sacrifice, and therefore to give that honour to the Maſſe that is onely due to Chriſt himſelfe is the moſt abominable Idolatry that the World ever heard of, for it giveth the ſame honour to a creature of mans making that is due to the Creator bleſſed for ever. And that ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoke of the firſt difference, and now I come to ſpeake of the ſecond diſcrepancy in reſpect of the matteriall cauſe. <hi>The matter of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Jeſus Chriſt was the humane nature, very man, that that was borne of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that was of the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>that ſuffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>that was crucified, dead and buried, and is now at the right Hand of God, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> But the matter of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe is <hi>not the humane nature, very man, and that that was borne of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that was of the ſeede of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>that ſuffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>that was crucified, dead and buried, and is now at the right hand of God, and made higher than the Heavens.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the ſacrifice of the Maſſe is not the ſame ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt that was offered upon the Croſſe; but a moſt prodigious Idoll that ought of all men
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:158688:87"/>to be abominated.</hi> For the Major, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> you cannot deny it, and for the Minor, no man, unleſſe he be bereaved of his ſenſes will deny it, and unleſſe he be unable to diſtinguiſh a peece of Bread, from the humane nature, for Chriſt retaines his humane nature ſtill, whereſoever hee is, and he bade <hi>Thomas</hi> for the confirmation of his weake faith to put his fingers into his ſide, and to prove the reality of his Reſurrection, and that hee was not a Spirit, hee ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. verſ. 39. <hi>Behold my hands and my Feete, for it is I my ſelfe: handle mee and ſee: for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as yee ſee mee have.</hi> So that, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> except a man have loſt all his ſenſes, hee will eaſily perceive the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt are two different things, for the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt had Fleſh, Bloud and Bones, the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, is neither fleſh, nor fiſh, nor good read Herring, it is neither Man nor Beaſt; I pray, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> anſwer mee ingenuouſly, do you really and indeed believe that that Breaden Wafer the Prieſt holdeth up in his hands, or that lieth upon the Altar, that Dagon of Ginger-bread is the very Chriſt, the Saviour of the World, who is now at the right Hand of God? doe you believe a peece of Bread to be God-man, doe you I ſay believe, that which is betweene the Prieſts hands, ever to have beene in the wombe of the Virgin, to be of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and to have ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident your conſcience telleth you the contrary, when you know that it is a meere peece of dow. How then dare you, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> give that honour to a peece of bread that is due to the Lord of life? Was there ever in the world a more unheard of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? And yet this, Maſter <hi>Montague,</hi> is the dayly ſervice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is worſe than the worſhiping of <hi>Molecke, Rimmon,</hi> or the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> and exceedeth all either heatheniſh or Iewiſh ſuperſtition. But now I come to ſhew the difference betweene them in reſpect of the formall cauſe. <hi>The Sacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt was the giving up of his Spirit into the hands of God his Father, the laying down of his life, the ſeparation of the humane ſoule from his body, and the effuſion of his bloud, and the wounding and piercing of his glorious Body; but in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe there is none of all this, you your ſelves calling it an unbloudy ſacrifice, and by virtue of your concomitancy as you tearme it, you joyne fleſh and bloud, ſoule and body together and make that whole which on the Croſſe was in all
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:158688:87"/>reſpects ſeparated:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Sacrifice of the Maſſe is not the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but a monſter to be abominated of all men, as that that robs Chriſt the Lord of his due honour, and all the adorers and worſhippers of it, of eternall happineſſe, who worſhip a peece of Bread for very God, and in that perpetrate the greateſt Idolatry that ever was committed: And ſo exclude themſelves out of Heaven, for, no Idolater ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. verſ. 8. <hi>But the Fearfull and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers and Idolaters, ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire, and which is the ſecond death.</hi> And therefore, M. <hi>Montague,</hi> it highly concerneth you to looke about you, and to conſider well what you do when you goe to Maſſe. But now I come to the laſt cauſe of difference. <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Jeſus Chriſt was of that virtue and efficacy, and offered up to this very end that it might be a ranſome for all believers,</hi> 1 Tim. chap. 2. verſ. 6. And Heb. 10.14. <hi>For by once offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. But the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, is neither of any power or efficacy, nor never yet perfected any, and by the confeſſion of the Papiſts themſelves muſt many times be reiterated to bring one poore ſoule out of their fained Purgatory, therefore in regard alſo of the end it is not the ſame, but differeth from the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ought to be caſt out of the World, as a beaſtly Idoll and an abomination and as a thing of no efficacy and power to ſave any man from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but all-ſufficient to damn ſoules and ſend them to perdition, and to bring downe the judgements of God upon the Nations and Kingdomes, where it is ſet up, as all Idolatry doth, for the Lord will judge thoſe Nations with all manner of plagues, that provoke him by their Idolatries, and after caſt them into the lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death; Which that, Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> you and all men may ſhun, it deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth you to conſult what a fearfull condition you yet are in, and all thoſe that are of the Faith and Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which is the Mother of all abomination: and duly alſo to weigh the haynouſneſſe of your offence, who cauſleſly ſo ſeparated your ſelfe from your Mother the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I have as I conceive ſufficiently in my foregoing diſcourſe proved to be a true Church, and built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter</hi> the ground and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Truth Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> That which I have now to ſay unto you is this. God hath given you excellent parts, and beſtowed many mercies and favours on you, and his long ſuffering, and patience
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:158688:88"/>towards you has beene great in all reſpects, who have hitherto imployed your gifts to wrong your own ſoule, and miſlead others, let it be enough, that you have gone ſo farre, and have hither ſo abuſed Gods loving kindneſſe towards you, knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth you to Repentance: and therefore take he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
